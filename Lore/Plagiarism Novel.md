> Some TLN things: The novel's main character is only ever referred to by the first person or as Oji-san. This is said a lot throughout and we decided to translate it as ‘old man’ this is not a perfect translation, Oji-san tends to have a more familial connotation (most dictionaries will translate it as uncle), but it works. In past albums that Yorushika made along with a novel, certain songs have corresponded with certain passages in the text which correspond nicely to the order of the album so lyric translations were done in the same doc as the novels. This is not the case in this album/novel however the songs are all canonically written by the protagonist and they do sometimes correspond to story events and the like.

# Prologue
I am a thief.

There have been various types of thieves throughout history, but I’m a little different from them.

I don’t steal money. I have no interest in antiques, jewelry or other valuable arts.

I am a thief who steals sound.

Jazz numbers that come from the radio. Pop songs that play through the city speakers. A singing voice echoing by the rotary in front of the station. A piano sonata coming from the municipal buildings hall.

I steal it. I'll steal it by recording it on this old voice recorder. I’ll steal it by humming. I'll steal it by transcribing it on a score sheet.

Since long ago, I've had a weakness for beautiful melodies.

  

When I first started, I was mostly requested to ghostwrite. Something to be sung by a new singer-songwriter, songs for a big actor to sing in a competition for their debut as a singer, commercial songs. Most of them just want something that sells. There’s a regularity to melodies made to sell. It can depend on how familiar you are with the words, but they usually can all be analyzed formulaically. Truly beautiful melodies have a magical power to them. A mysterious charm that grasps me and doesn’t let go.

  

Even people’s humming is packed with the essence of a masterpiece. The moment they bother to open their mouths and let out a sound is usually my favorite phrase in a song. I end up replaying it in my head over and over again. It ends up as a mirror that reflects the tastes of the general public.

Whether it's pop, jazz, or rock and roll, they’re all composed around rhythm. Two-beat, four-beat, eight-beat, dance beat, slip beat, shuffle beat...The foundation of the jazz bop song coming from this voice recorder right now is a shuffle beat. After you’ve grasped the beat, analyze the chords. After you have the chords is the face of the music; the melody. Rhythm, chords, melody. Music is formed out of these three elements.

  

Apply the analyzed music to the client, or rather the general music taste of the world, to create the general form of the song. Sometimes you can draw/pull from rhythm tracks. Sometimes you can cite a classical masterpiece and within a few seconds people will easily hear, ‘the melody from the piece that is said to be beautiful.’ The music created by following these steps was generally well-received.

  

I don't believe in talent. Most musicians who are said to be geniuses are just fakes. Of course I am no exception.

  

It seems that people are lying when they say that musical composition ended during the time of Bach, but I think even that may be correct. Nowadays people play music all over the world. Melodies are constructed from a scale of only twelve notes over a couple of octaves. If that’s the case then that masterpiece, that popular song on the radio, even this stylish jazz bop, must be a melody that was once played somewhere in the history of music.

That hasn’t changed.
# One
I met that boy at the end of spring in a certain year. The world looked forward to this global festival, and the whole country was astir.

He wasn’t any older than ten, and he was small, but he was brimming with curiosity. He asked a lot of questions, while he was seated on the office couch, as he touched the piano at the corner of the room, as he gazed at the sunset from the balcony.

He asked about music, the world, relationships, the artwork around the room, the place I grew up in, about how to read sheet music, how to play the piano, how to deal with all sorts of absurdity… and about my wife. When I think about it, there wasn’t an end to them. After all this time I still don’t understand why, but perhaps to him, asking all those questions was a way to converse with an adult he didn’t even know the name of. Anyway, when he felt at ease with you, he was a boy of many words. And in those words was a heart just as young.

His eyes were light brown.

They were like the color of varnished wood. With an inquisitive gaze, he ran restlessly all over the place. The setting sun reflected in those pupils of his, and within the dimly lit office, his irises were the only thing shining. In his gaze, there was an unassertive loneliness that peeked in and out of view. I had never met him before then, but at times I felt as if I’d seen him somewhere.

  

The light rain from outside the window stopped, without me noticing

I held out my arm and pressed the stop button on the radio on the table. The cold sensation on my fingertip disappeared, and so did the music that permeated the room. I let go of the button. It went back up with a clink. At that moment, silence enveloped the room, and I could only hear myself breathing. The setting sun shone into the window and onto that radio, casting a shadow on the staff paper.

I drew back the chair I’d sunk deep into, corrected my posture a bit, and did some light stretches. I put down the pencil I was holding in my right hand. It rolled on the table, and when it hit the edge of the paper, it wobbled unsteadily. A few hours had passed since I started writing. The B4-size sheet had only been halfway filled, but if you included all the ones I didn’t like and discarded, then this was already the fourth sheet.

That day, I was thinking about something. It wasn’t about how I was running out of canned coffee even though I bought a bunch of them all at once. I was thinking about my wife.

I didn’t just start thinking about her then, but around that time I’d been reminiscing about her more. I had just finished a big job, and I was probably exhausted. Her death anniversary was still far away, but I thought it’d be fine to visit her grave before summer began.

I grabbed the writing materials scattered across the table in one hand, and crammed them all into the tall glass I was using in lieu of a pencil case. The pencils clanked as they touched the glass.

All of a sudden, I got thirsty.

I finished what was left of my coffee, and got up from my chair. Cutting between the couch by the window and the coffee table, I took the leather wallet from the shelf on the side, and headed to the entryway.

  

The room I call my office is in a multi-tenant building a short walk away from Tachikawa Station. I started renting the place about ten years ago, when I started working on music. The rent isn’t expensive, the room itself is relatively spacious, and it even has light soundproofing. Even though I play my upright piano and guitar a lot, so far I haven’t gotten any complaints about that.

Right outside the building, the road extended straight toward the station. Because of its convenience, this path sees a lot of foot traffic, and along it line numerous establishments up to the area near the station. All sorts of businesses, from restaurants to general stores, are squeezed together into cramped tenant buildings, lined up and awfully narrow-looking. I call it the “main street.”

In May, the main street sees very few people, and the winds at the end of spring blow quietly, carrying the moisture left over by a rainshower. A mess of sounds flood the neighborhood.

The cawing of crows. Conversations between pedestrians. The sound of a small puddle being stepped on. A car brake. The sound of a stoplight. And pop music leaking out of the shops. The setting sun reflecting off the store windows.

I kept walking while I listened to the sounds of the neighborhood. If it had been any other day, as soon as I got out of the building I’d buy coffee from a vending machine, and go straight back to that room. But that day was different. An “out of order” sign was placed on the vending machine. I left the office just to get a can of coffee, but now I actually needed to go look for one.

As I approached the street corner, I finally found another vending machine. It was installed in a parking lot along a side street.

  

I walked toward the vending machine, put in some loose change from my wallet, and pressed the button. With a sound, the can of coffee rolled out, and I shoved my hand into the open compartment.

That was when it happened.

Smash! I heard it from somewhere at a distance. I stopped moving to grab the can.

It was a weird sound, as if something was broken. It was grating; a clear, high-pitched, and explosive sound. If I were to give an example, it would be like when a glass cup fell off a shelf.

Then as I listened closely, the faraway sounds of a cawing crow and a car horn blended together and once more, I heard a crash.

No mistaking it. Something definitely got smashed.

As if I was being lured, I peeked into an alley.

  

Glass was scattered all around the place.

Red, blue, emerald green, and dull transparent.

Glass shards of all sorts of colors. All broken, they looked like blossoms scattered in the asphalt, glittering under the setting sun.

It was… How do I say this? Something must’ve happened. So I thought it over.

I approached the shards and picked one up. It looked like it was originally round in shape, as it curved around. When I held it up toward the sun, it gave off an enchanting gleam.

I looked around the area. It was a back alley sandwiched between a building and yet another building. At the end of the road, I could just see the setting sun, faintly illuminating the back alley

Each of the scattered shards reflected that sunlight.

The sound of footsteps down a staircase echoed from inside a multi-tenant building.

  

I stood up. The sound slowly grew louder, as they neared the ground.

After a short while, an emergency exit door nearby opened, and a small head peeked out of the gap.

There appeared a boy, who then froze as he came out of the door.

“Ah,” the boy uttered.

I turned to face him, and saw his face.

He looked timid. Black hair cut roughly to an even length, light brown eyes. He must’ve been the type whose feelings easily get written on his face, as his eyebrows already furrowed in worry.

The boy quickly stepped out of the door, and mumbled as he closed it. The slow and grating sound of the metal door echoed around the alley.

“Is this yours?” I picked up a shard, and placed it on my palm, to show it to him.

“Yeah,” the boy awkwardly muttered, averting his gaze from the small, red fragment on my hand. “I dropped it.”

He pointed up.

I looked up, and saw a balcony protruding from the wall right above the place of impact. I wonder if it slipped from his hands? I thought.

“You better be careful next time,” I said.

“Yeah.” He nodded.

When I asked if he wanted me to help clean up, the boy shook his head in a flurry.

Well, it is suspicious for a passerby to talk like that to someone. I decided to leave as soon as I could, trying to shake off the curiosity welling up in my head.

When I turned around and began to walk, I heard the sound of clinking glass from behind me. Going via the parking lot where the vending machine was, I was about to head into the main street when I glanced toward the back alley out of the corner of my eye, and met eyes with the boy just for a moment.

I turned my gaze back toward the main street, and went on my way back. From the path, I had a panoramic view of the sky. The afterglow looked as if night was melting. The can of coffee in my pants’ pocket was certainly cold, and thus I was sure that it was there.

When I returned to my office, a single room in a multi-tenant building, the boy completely drifted out of my mind.

  

I remember.

Up to the very end, I never got to know what the boy’s name was. All those months, I never asked what it was, and he only called me “old man.”

> “The first piece of music I heard? To be honest, I don’t quite remember, but my father always played classical records in our living room. I thought that a sound you’d call a fine performance was kinda different, and as it turned out, what I was interested in was melodies. Beautiful melodies have a strange magical power to them. The performer playing it may also have their own power, but the melody of a masterpiece… no matter who plays it, that beauty would surely be preserved.
> 
> Whether it’s a momentary whistle, the orderly harmony of a choir, or even a child playing on a lousy piano, they all have an intrinsic value that can never be altered.
> 
> Even if it’s not played from a concert hall and played from the top of a record instead, it makes no difference.. Of course,that goes for the melodies that play over my music too, I’d imagine.
> 
> Do you believe in originality? I never did, even from the very start. My… first-ever experience as a musician… was by playing classical music. It’s a world where you draw from the classics and express them. Even if the nuances or tempo are played with, even if  the methods of expression differ, never will they take away from the melody written in the original manuscript. It’s a world where a single change of note makes a composition. Even if you play Moonlight Sonata once. All the world’s pianists keep searching for the “right answer” that only exists in Beethoven’s mind. .
> 
> It might be wrong for me to say as a musician, but we live in a world where originality to the point of astonishment cannot exist. That idea is the foundation of my music. It’s the same for other compositions, too. I’ve recognized that somewhere down the line.
> 
> It’s just as I said at the start. The melodies we create and fancy have already been played somewhere else. Entire centuries have passed since the concept of equal temperament was born. In this age, is there really such a thing as an original—as an impressively beautiful melodic pattern? ‘That’s alright; perhaps there may still be some left somewhere,’’ That’s probably what you’re thinking, isn’t it?.

> I wonder if you know about the infinite monkey theorem. It suppos es that if you let a monkey hit the keys on a typewriter for eternity, someday it could even type a play by Shakespeare.

> What we’re doing may be close to that.”
# Two
I remember. 

Clink — the sound of hard things hitting against each other rings out in the store.

The interior of the general goods store I visited during my walk was unnaturally quiet, but I could hear the hustle and bustle of the street outside through the entrance.

The silence between songs ended and the next song started fading in, filling the store with music.

When I looked to where the sound came from I saw a child trying to reach for something on a shelf.

I thought I had seen this kid before. I remembered back to a short time ago, to the pieces of glass scattered in a back alley and the awkward look on a boy's face.

The tip of the boy’s hand hidden in the shelf touched what he was reaching for, and again the sound rang.

Clink, clink.

Was he trying to grab something back there? Three tiers from the top shelf , the boy was not yet tall enough to grab it.

When I looked to the counter, I saw that the shop owner had withdrawn to the back and no one else was there.

The boy touched it again, just a bit more, stretching out. The sound rang again. No matter how you looked at it, the boy had gotten himself in a rather tricky situation.

I approached the boy from the side and took what he was reaching for. 

It was a figurine of a rabbit, made of beautiful glasswork. It had an elaborate structure of various colors from head to tail, mixed to become one creature.

“Is this it?”

The boy beamed at me and bowed his head to receive it.

Apparently, he didn't realize we had met before.

I’ve always had a good memory.

He replied with a muttered “thank you” and I returned to where I was before.

I went to look at the light crimson tapestry on the wall as music filled the room again.

From the speaker hung in the corner ceiling, a classical piano performance played.

The shop itself was a bit weird, but it had good taste. Not only general goods but also miscellaneous music.

At that moment they were playing Gymnopedie No. 1.

A piano solo composed by Erik Satie in 1888. The loose and inorganic melody felt somehow comfortable. The scale sounds cold but sometimes soft. It's been played a lot recently in places such as cafes and general stores with calm atmospheres,. but it is a song that is based in negative emotions. 

Satie commented on the piece itself: ‘Slow and Mournfully’

The clink clink sounded out again. 

I looked to the side of the store.

The boy had his shoulder tote bag open a little. While holding the rabbit that was just in my right hand, he was looking at the counter.

His behaviour was clearly suspicious.

The boy suddenly turned his head to me, so I pretended to still be looking at the tapestry on the wall.

He turned back away. I was stealing a look at him from the edge of my vision. 

He lifted his arm and slowly opened the mouth of the tote bag as to put something in. 

A gentle arpeggio played.

Slowly, slowly, the mouth opened. He occasionally turned his gaze towards me and each time would stop moving his arm.

I could hear the sound of the second hand on the clock getting louder.

Just a bit more, just a tiny bit.

In a few moments it will be in the bag.

If you lift your arm just a bit and release your finger, it will be swallowed by the mouth of the bag.

  

A noise echoed from the back of the store.

There was a rattling and I heard someone coming from the back.

The shopkeeper reappeared at the counter.

After glancing at the boy in front of the shelf and me in front of the tapestry, he sat down in his chair in the corner of the store.

The tone of the piece playing from the speaker had changed slightly.

Gymnopedie No. 1 was over and it had switched to Gymnopedie No. 2.
# Three
“I’m sorry,” the boy said in a quiet voice as if whispering. 

Even though he had left the store, his voice was broken, and he shrunk into himself, embarrassed. 

The May wind blew through the main street of the city, leaving cold air in its wake. 

“There’s no point in apologizing to me,” I responded. 

The boy’s tote bag—and it may have been because of the size of the stolen rabbit ornament—had a somewhat unnatural bulge to it. 

“Do you like it?” With that question, the boy thought a bit and then shook his head,

 “Not really.”

“Do you like glass, then?”

 I thought back to the incident in the alley. I wondered if he had been messing around with that glass on the upper floor.

“You’re wrong.” 

Involuntarily, I let the shock slip into my voice, 

“You stole it, even though you didn’t even want it?”

The boy stayed silent.

“Well, whatever. It doesn’t really affect me, anyway.” 

Even I could tell that my timing with that line was suspicious, but I didn’t want him to think that I was helping him.

“If you’re going to do it, at least do it when nobody else is around.” 

As if shooing him away, I hit the still-silent boy on the back twice with the back of my hand.

 He started to walk away slowly at first, but then picked up his pace and disappeared into the crowd. 

I watched until he was gone and then returned to the store.

  

A few minutes later, after I stepped out of the store with the tapestry I bought, I saw the boy standing at the side of the building. Did he come back? I thought.

The boy looked at me and apologized once more.

“No need to tell it to me.”

As I continued to  walk out of there, the boy said that he felt unnerved somehow.

“You’re not mad at me?” he asked.

“No. Like I already told you, it doesn’t affect me.” 

I looked at his face and sighed.

“Do you like when someone is mad at you?”

“No.”

“Great. Then if you feel bad about it, you can pay it back yourself one day.”

The boy stayed silent and kept looking down towards the ground. 

It’s like I’m bullying him or something, I thought.

“Shouldn’t you be at school?”

“It’s a Sunday today”

“I see. It is, isn’t it?”

The spring sunlight shined down onto the main street. 

The boy opened his mouth and then closed it again.

 Like a goldfish that was spilled from its tank, his mouth opened, then closed—over and over again.

“What’s wrong?”

The boy said nothing.

A salaryman-like gentleman came at us from the front, and stared at us shamelessly as he passed by. 

I saw, through the display window, the owner of the store stand up. 

Perhaps because he saw him too, the color in the boy’s face changed.

“See ya,” I said. 

I tapped the boy’s shoulder and started to walk away. 

The sound of Gymnopedie was still knocking around in my skull. 

It was such a beautiful melody. As I was humming it, I thought back to the pieces I had heard in the shop from before.

What played right before Gymnopedie was Debussy’s composition, Clair de Lune (Light of the Moon). And before that, Maurice Ravel, Pavane for a Dead Princess. Before that; Chopin, Nocturne No. 1. In those countless melodies, I saw scenery come to life. 

The smell of old paper. The smoke of cigarettes. Books lined up in rows. Manuscript paper and fountain pens. 

Dust particles floating in the air visibly. Light passing through the gaps of a window, raining down on the back of a man.

A spinning, somber vinyl record. The performance of classic piano flowing through a slightly opened door.

I remember my father’s study. 

  

Residing within beautiful melodies is a magical power.

The one that connects all of those songs together, even if it lacks consistency,  must be incredibly beautiful.

The station came into view as I made my way down the road.

As I sipped coffee from the station cafe, I started to think, I should get back to work. 

Suddenly, I felt eyes staring at my back, and I stole a glance behind me.

There was the silhouette of a small figure that I had seen very recently.

He must have followed me. When I went to take a turn, the boy clearly turned after me.

When I stopped walking, I would hear his footsteps stop, too. 

I stopped humming.

The thought of the Pied Piper came to mind, and a sigh escaped my mouth.

> “How to plagiarize? Well isn’t that something you’d like to know. Let’s introduce my methods, really anyone could use the ones I often did.
> 
> The first method you need to know is how to extract the melody from a song exactly as it is.
> 
> Once you've gotten good at this it becomes quite a useful technique. Partially borrow a melody you like and place it in a key of a song such that it is not dissonant with the chords you are using. If the song you pull the melody from is in the same language as the one you're making, it's easy to steal even the consonants. Particularly in regards to the melody, lines with a sibilant s, or plosive k or t, can all be used together. If you want to make a vocal melody that sounds good, you should think about the pronunciation of such words together.
> 
> It's a rough example, but let's consider the example of the Tulip.
> 
> ‘The blooming tulip flowers[[#^1]]
> 
> I feel that the consonantes strongly emphasized in this melody are the ‘s’ in ‘saita,’ the ‘t’ in ‘tulip’ and the h in ‘hana.’ No matter how much you change the lyrics, if you emphasize those syllables the melody will generally stay the same. 
> 
>   
> 
> Next is the harmony. In other words, the chords.
> 
> This is very easy. If you have the sheet music that's good, if not you use your ear. For any given chord at any time in a song, first find the root note, then stack notes you hear harmonize with it and what sounds dissonant. And with that you have the chord.
> 
> By analyzing each harmony one by one, you can begin to see the overall flow of the song. If you find a chord progression that you like, you can just borrow it.
> 
> Chords are the background of the melody. It can also be called its spine.
> 
> The flow of the song determines the song's world view. A scale that makes you think of a rainforest. A melody reminiscent of the loneliness of the darkness of an abandoned place. The gentle murmur of a flowing river. If there is a song that leaves an impression on me, it is usually through the background set by the chords. 
> 
> Despite that most people are unaware of that. They are always only listening to the melody of the song. Thats why, for example, even if you circulate an entire section of chords that you borrowed multiple times, people won’t notice. Most music in the world is formed from the layering of such chords. 
> 
>   
> 
> The world is overflowing with beautiful chords. 
> 
> The most famous chord progression is undoubtedly the Canon progression. This comes from Pachelbel's Canon. If you were to walk out into the town and listen to the music you will probably hear it once. Songs that use almost the same canon progression are still being made today.
> 
> Now do you see the difference between plagiarism and homage? If you know, do you think the public does?
> 
> And I also want to ask you this: Let’s say, hypothetically, there was something playing on the radio that you thought was beautiful. Whether the composer thought long and hard about the chords or if they pulled them from passed masterpieces, does the value of the chords change?

> Where else the sound was used, the composer’s struggles, their history, all of that is just information. There's talk about how information can affect the way that people experience flavor but can information on music affect the way we hear it? What do you think? “

- The blooming tulip flowers (咲いた咲いたチューリップの花が, saita saita tulip no hana ga) is a [Japanese nursery rhyme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTfuEsZON4A), you can tell it’s a very simple melody. A Japanese audience would probably recognize it, so this part’s pretty cutesy. ^1
# Four
The boy and I sat down on one of the benches lined up along the rotary in front of the station.

He stayed silent as he licked through his ice cream.

While I watched the people exiting the station, I was thinking about what I should say.

“Look, I don’t plan on talking to the store owner or anybody else about this, and I’m not planning on taking you back there.”

No reply.

“You listening?”

“Yeah,” he replied, but his voice was almost drowned out by the hustle and bustle around us.

Was I also this cold when I was a kid? I thought.

Some of the ice cream was melting from the rim of the cone, forming a line across the back of his hand. Seeing him get rattled out of the corner of my eye, I took out a handkerchief from my pocket and wiped it off.

“Do you like ice cream?”

Right before we sat down, he had bought that ice cream cone from a shop his eyes were fixed on.

“Mhm.”

“I don’t like sweet stuff.”

Some of the ice cream had even fallen onto his pants, leaving a small mark.

I wiped off the ice cream gently, telling him to have them washed at home afterwards, then I put away my handkerchief.

“Thanks,” he said.

“When you’re done, go somewhere else.”

“Yeah.”

I took out the voice recorder from my bag, turned it on, and placed it on the bench.

“What’s that?”

Seeing how he faltered as he asked, I replied, “It’s for work.”

“What does it do?”

“It records sound.”

“Sound?”

“Yeah.”

The latest pop craze was playing from the storefronts nearby.

The boy kept eating his ice cream while looking at the recorder, seemingly engrossed.

“Is there a job where you just record sounds?”

“You probably don’t know about it.”

While I watched a group of women having a friendly chat as they walked along, the sunlight made me squint.

“In this age , there’s a sound that sells for a high price.”

The boy let out a “hmm” to show he was paying attention.

“Eh, is it playing right now?”

“Uh-huh.”

“Really? What is it?”

I pointed toward the nearby storefronts.

Pop music was streaming out of an open door.

“That shop?”

“Uh-huh.”

“But…”

He sounded perplexed.

“That’s just music.”

“Yup. But, that mere music can turn into money. That’s my job.”

“I don’t get it,” he said.

It’ll be a pain even if I explain the details, I thought.

For a moment, silence fell between us.

“How about your parents?”

“Huh?”

“What kind of work do they do?”

He must’ve been surprised by the sudden question; the hand he was moving to lick his ice cream cone stopped. 

“My mom…”

He spoke with a hesitant tone.

“She makes glass.”

“Glass?”

“Mhm.”

“Wasn’t there a glass factory around here?”

“That’s not it,” the boy denied it. “She has a studio, she makes glass there. Stained glass.”

“Oh?” I let out. “Stained glass, like the stuff that’s on church windows?”

I got curious and asked.

“Hmh, those big patches with lots of colors. She makes them by hand one by one.”

He got a bit talkative. He made triangles and squares and other such shapes with his fingers, showing each of them to me.

“They’re beautiful.”

I heard a woman humming as she walked close by.

I nodded to the sound of traffic and people.

As he licked the melting ice cream, he let out a meaningless hum.

In my head, the colorful glass shards scattered around the ground came back in a flashback.

“Yeah,” I agreed to myself.

“Then, that thing you dropped the other day, did your mom make it?”

Looked like I hit the mark; the boy’s face darkened.

“She must have gotten pretty mad at you.”

A man in a suit quickly passed us by.

“No.” The boy denied it. “She said nothing.”

“Nothing?”

“Mhm.”

I asked, “Not on good terms with her?”

“It’s not that,” he said. Drops of ice cream dripped from the edge of the cone, making new stains on his pants.

A group of students who got out of the station were talking about the pop song playing from the storefronts as they walked along.

“She said nothing.”

I listen to the hustle and bustle.

  

It was a rainy Saturday that week.

There were a lot of useless things around the office, but not a single umbrella.

It’d be a pain to go buy coffee like this, I thought.

To kill some time, I gathered the newspapers and magazines on the shelf and carried them to the table. I sat down on the couch and read a newspaper.

After I finished reading a few, I picked up a magazine.

As I skimmed through the nth issue of a lifestyle magazine, a certain article caught my eye.

It was about a glass artist who made stained glass. It had the picture of a woman and a small profile. Feeling like I remembered that face from somewhere, I turned the page.

The rain stopped, and I went out. The smell of wet asphalt enveloped the entire alley. I walked down the stairs and headed to the main street.

Along the way, I passed by that back alley, but no one was there.

I remember.

I was sitting on a bench shaded by a tree in the memorial park a short walk away from the station.

Above me, I could see that the foliage grew thick, letting the sunlight through in sparse patches. 

“Old man.”

I heard someone’s voice, and tilting my head down from looking at the leaves, I confirmed the voice’s owner.

I've seen this face somewhere, I thought. It had been a few weeks, hadn’t it? The young boy from that time was standing there.

“Uh…”

The boy thought it was fine to call out to me but he didn’t know what he should say after that so he ended up just standing there. 

“The weather’s nice, isn’t it.” I said

“Hmh” he replied. “What are you doing?”

The boy slowly made his way to sit down next to me as he asked.

“Watching the sakura.”

“Haven’t the petals all already fallen?”

The boy had a confused looked on his face.

“I like the sakura leaves as well.” I casually added on.

A bit of a ways away, I could see a family playing with a dog. The german shepherd would chase after the frisbee that the children threw and catch it.

“Are you picnicking?”

“Hm?”

“There's no way you came here alone. Did you come with your parents?”

Seeming to have understood what I said, the boy nodded.

“Over there. She’s talking with someone.”

“I see. She’s probably getting worried, so you should get back to them quickly.”

“It's a pretty long conversation, so it's fine.”

When the boy started talking about his mother, his voice dropped.

On that Sunday, he was probably talking with his mom, I thought to myself.

“And you?” the boy continued, “Why are you here?”

“I was going for a stroll. If all you do is work, your body falters.”

“Falters?”

“Bad for your health basically.”

“Hmm.”

Far out, the children threw the frisbee again. It drew a beatiful arc in the air before falling towards the ground and being picked up by the german shepherd chasing it. 

“It's a dog,” the boy said.

I silently watched.

“Must be nice...”

I remembered something like a flashback.

Someone's voice overlapped in my mind. A long time ago, there was someone here who said the same thing.

“I don’t really like dogs.”

“Why not? They're cute.”

“My wife was allergic.”

“That's too bad.”

“Even though she liked dogs more than I did. It's quite a strange story.”

My wife had a talent for being loved by animals. Especially when it came to dogs, she would make friends with even unfamiliar stray dogs. Did her smell have a kindness to it? We would often come to this park together on days off. The dogs being walked would approach her with interest. She loved the dogs that sniffed her as she sat on the bench and would hug them gently.

One day, she began to develop allergic symptoms and she became unable to touch any animal. They all wanted to touch her, but she couldn’t touch them. It really is a strange story.

“That’s why it's been awhile since I came here.”

There's a dog park on the south side of the park and on sunny days, many dogs would come here. 

“Is she coming?”

“She went somewhere,” I said. The young boy sat next to me.

“Then let's keep talking until she returns.”

“Are you free?”

“Hmh.”

“I see. Until she returns then.”

The dry pre-rainy season winds blew and shook the trees. 

They made a smooth sound, like stroking a stringed instrument with your finger.

“Old man, tell me something interesting.”

“You’re surprisingly cheeky, aren’t you? Well, I guess that’s ok.”

I pointed to the towering zelkova tree in the middle of the park. 

“In the middle of the park, there's a massive tree”

“Hmh.”

“Thieves would often come from there.”

“Huh?!”

The boy raised his voice, seeming astonished, “Really?” he asked.

“You know how there's a free admission day a couple times a year? Because of that, many people enter the park.”

“Hmh.”

“Just like when the sakura petals are blooming, many people will lie down on a picnic sheet around the tree. That's the aim.”

“Why do you know about this?”

“I know a thief.”

The boy's eyes were wide open.

“Is that good?”

“Of course that’s not good.”

“That makes sense.”

“That guy’s already cleaned his feet up, but those sorts of people are still around, aren't they? Not just here, but all sorts of places.”

“Clean your feet?” the boy asked while staring at my feet.

I was struck by his naivety and laughed.

“It's not about actually cleaning something. Do you see anyone here actually cleaning?. I meant that they quit being a thief.

“It's about quitting.”

“Yeah.” I said. “Well, kids like you probably don’t have stuff they’ve stolen before, so you wouldn’t have many opportunities to use it.”

The boy let out a short laugh as if it got stuck in his throat on the way up.

I wonder if a normal child like this steals? I thought.

“Is your mom off from work today?”

“Hmh. Sunday is always her day off from work.”

“She's a glassworker, right?”

“Hmh.” The boy nodded.

“So you must have a glass workshop in your house. Seems interesting.”

“No, the house is elsewhere. She has another room in the building from that one time.”

“Oh right. That time.”

“Hmh.”

I remember the alleyway with the scattered glass. That one room could function as a workshop I suppose.

“Y’know, there are machines there this big” he spread his small hands out for effect. “There's a box there with lots of pretty glass in it. I would choose things from it and put them on my desk. Then I connect all the pieces together.”

The boy's voice brightened up. 

“Hm,” I said to show my interest. “I think I’d like to see that.”

“Really? Well then, next time I’ll show it to you.” After proudly saying that to me, his voice dropped a little. “But I have other stuff to do. I think I’m going somewhere in the evening. Bringing me here with her today was supposed to be a make up, too. ”

I silently listened to him.

He talked for a while, and in that time, the sun became hidden behind a cloud, making the borders between the shadows cast on the ground ambiguous.

I saw a woman in the distance with her hair tied up start walking in our direction.

“It's my mom” the boy muttered.

I lightly tapped the boys back to get him to stand up.

The boy walked to the woman, who was now rushing towards him. The boy said two or three words to his mom, and she came over to thank me. Still sitting down, I bowed my head to her.

The two of them disappeared to the end of the road like that.

  

The wind was still blowing. I raised my head to the sakura trees that were just leaves at this point. 

Every time spring came, I would come here with her, the two of us. 

“It's lonely only being able to see spring fifty more times, assuming humans live to eighty,” she would say. “I can't help always thinking about the future. It'd be nice if I could watch the sakura without thinking about anything.” I would always say, “Either way, we're gonna be together for the rest of our lives”

The child playing with the dog on the grass accidentally threw the disc in the wrong direction than usual. 

The blue disk bounced a couple times then rolled in my direction.

I started to stand up to go grab it but I stopped and sat back down.

I watched as the dog went to pick and return back to his place as fast as he could.

In the summer before I turned eight, I found an iron box in my garage.

It contained a variety of tools from mallets, to saws, to soldering irons to files. I didn't know what most of them were, what they were used for or how to use them. I had spare time though, so I made a wooden box through imitating what others did.The end product was awkward, but it turned out better than I expected. I wanted to show off my talent to someone.

Then, I remembered that her birthday was coming soon

I cut, shaved, and nailed together pieces of wood of all sorts of shapes and sizes from the nearby timber store. I thought hard with my knowledgeless mind.

Thick pieces of wood don't look good, but ones that are too thin don’t nail down properly. A sawed surface looks awkward, so you need to file it down and shape it with sandpaper. If the wood is not evenly measured, its shape will collapse when made into a box. You have to apply wax to make the surface glossy. When there was something I didn’t understand, I would ask an adult at the lumber shop. Gradually, my work became better.

When the day arrived, I headed to our meeting place with my completed box.

Down the hill from me, I could see her at the bus stop.

It was only then, when I saw her sitting as she always did, that I realized how childish the object I was carrying really was. I found myself petrified. She was only in middle school at the time, but she had grown up a lot during that summer.

She found me with a sideways glance. She put the haiku collection she was holding in her hands down on the bench and walked up to me, smiling and waving her hand.

I was thinking hard. Standing there frozen still, I gulped. I had the thought that I should hide the box somewhere, but there didn’t seem to be time. As I panicked there in place,  she came up to me. She had a soft and gentle scent to her.

“What are you trying to do with that?” she asked.

“Pencil case,” I said, still grasping the edge of that long, thin box.

She took it from my hand and examined it - turning it around some, holding it up to the sun.

“Did you make this yourself?” she asked.

I nodded. “It’s a present,” I managed to add on.

“Really?” her voice leaked out.

“Cause it's your birthday,” I continued. I looked at her eyes. Light brown. That was the color of those eyes I loved so much..With a surprised look on her face, she compared the box to me and then smiled wide.

She gave me a gentle hug.

In that moment, I could smell the summer.

  

One day, in the afternoon, I found it in the corridor of my office on a shelf. ‘Pencil Case’ was written on top, it was the same slender wooden box I had given her all that time ago.

The paint had peeled off over the years and there were small scratches on it, but I could see it had been used carefully. When I opened it, it was empty. There was nothing inside.

She gave me a look over from the kitchen.

“I brought that with me,” she said smiling. Her eyes hadn’t changed since that day. 

I looked at the ‘Pencil Case.’ It was my first piece. My first experience making something.

I turned towards my wife, “You still have it?”Looking at her face, I thought that maybe I should make something again for a change.

Then, several years passed. Things started to pile up in that room. Even after my wife was gone, I continued to create works. I made whatever I could think of. The act of creating began to shape me.

Painting, prints, chigiri-e, writing, photography, crafts such as woodworking, metalworking, and pottery.

And then music.

I blindly continued to create.

  

On Sunday, the boy had said he would show me his mother's workshop, so I went to that back alley from before.

It was a good opportunity to see the creative process.

When I knocked on the door in the multi-tenant building, there was a rattling noise from behind it.

The door opened quickly, and the boy appeared in front of me.

“You can come in,” he said. I did as he said, stepping through the front door.

“Is it really okay to come in on a weekend?”

“Hmh. Mom’s always at her part-time job on Sundays.”

I furrowed my eyebrows without thinking.

“What if I was a bad person?”

“Are you a bad person, old man?”

“No, but what if I was a thief just waiting for your parents to leave?”

“Another story about thieves?”

The boy closed the door behind me and locked it.

I took off my shoes and placed them in the shoe box. Various tools were left out around the entrance.

“But you aren’t a thief, are you, old man?”

“Well, I wonder - am I?”

“Are you a thief?”

“I am,” I said. The boy's eyes grew to the size of platters.

“But don’t worry, I dont steal things that don't make money.”

“Then I guess it’s ok then”

Did the boy take that as a joke? I didn’t ask any further.

He opened the door at the end of a short corridor and revealed a large workbench. It took up the size of six tatami mats and had a huge blue glass sheet on top of it. 

There were other various machines in the back of the room. Some of them were familiar. There was a belt sander for polishing that I recognized from when I used to have one for woodworking. They probably do finer adjustments to the width of the glass with it too.

The wall right next to the entrance of the room was for storage. The folding door was open so I could see that it was originally a closet. I saw dozens of glass sheets and other materials stored together in there. The huge walk-in closet was probably made for drunken residents, but it seemed to be in use as a storeroom.

Next to the closet were some tall shelves. In addition to tools and materials, there were some glass crafts that the boy's mom must have made. 

“Is this what she's working on right now?” I asked as I approached the workbench where the large glass sheet was placed. 

When I looked closely, I could see there were thin lines drawn on the glass which seemed to separate it into parts. Was it going to be split using the outlines?

“She does a glass cut on it.”

“So she cuts it first?”

“Hmh, The plans are drawn out on paper and then the lines are drawn to match.”

You make the pieces by cutting the parts out first, then.

 “I see,” I said.

The full scale design seemed to be hanging on the wall. Is it being made according to this? I thought.

“Cutting glass is really fun,y’know.”

Pulling on my sleeves, he brought me to the other side of the workbench. There was a small work desk in the corner of the room. 

Even though he seemed embarrassed about it, the boy said, “Recently, when my mom has free time, she’s been teaching me.” 

I was impressed.

He picked up a piece of thin red glass that had been left on the desk. It seemed like the uncleaned places were where he had taken over.  

“Look look,” he said and drew a line on the glass sheet, “This is a glass cutter”

The boy had a pen-like object in his hand.

“You cut with that?”

“No, you can only make scratches.”

While he talked, he picked up a thick ruler that had been placed on his desk and placed it on the glass.

Then, he put the glass cutter against it and carefully moved his hand from top to bottom.

It made a small grinding sound as it went along.

“Now it’s ready,” The boy said, turning the glass cutter over,

If the glass cutter were a ballpoint pen, then you could imagine he turned it to the blunt end.

“Here I go.”

The boy started from the back side.

Carefully, he followed the scratches, hitting the pieces in-between with the cutter.  

He moved from bottom to top.

The glass cracked visibly along the lines he made.　

And then, the moment he hit the last piece, it broke apart cleanly.

Without thinking, I let out the breath I was holding.

“I see.”

“I don't know why, but if you hit it from the back of the cut, it will crack. Also, my mom usually uses a pair of pliers or something to pinch it as she breaks it.”

Apparently, it’s some process that takes advantage of the properties of glass. Glass is weak to pulling forces. 

If you hit it from behind, then it spreads the scratches and breaks under its own weight.

When I looked at the make of the glass cutter he was holding, I could see there was liquid inside. Does it spray out the tip when scratching to help break the glass? The pliers that his mom uses would probably help with this.

“This really is interesting.”

“Isn't it amazing?” the boy said, his voice brightening at the end as if he himself were complimented. 

“Do you wanna try, old man?” he said, moving to give me the spot at the desk.

Just like I saw him do, I picked up a piece of glass on the desk.

I placed the ruler down and drew a line with the glass cutter.

The cutter made a scratching sound. This was completely different from writing with a pen. The feeling itself is hard to explain.

I flipped the glass and, using the other end of the glass cutter, hit along the lines.

The glass broke along the cuts and then it quietly broke apart.

“Wow, you're good at this!” His eyes were wide open.

“Well, I am a craftsman,” I responded, “What do I do after this?” I continued.

“After you’ve cut your parts. You make it into something?”

He pointed to a glass panel on a shelf with a bright rose pattern. Something you’d usually see at a church.

“Uh… You use this”

The boy rushed to a shelf and brought a box with something in it to the desk.

When I looked in it I could see several metal wires that were put together, rail looking parts and some tools shaped like screwdrivers.

“Is this a soldering iron?” I asked, picking one of the tools up.

“Yep. Do you know of it?”

“Yeah.”

Soldering is a technique in which you use a filler metal called solder to bond other metals together. It is also used on electronic boards. 

Next, I picked out an oblong-shaped metal object. It was in an H shape.

“That thing is, what was it again. I think it's called came. Or something.”

“How do you use it?”

“Um, well, sometimes it's something you use to combine pieces of glass, it's what you put in between them.“

“Sometimes?”

“Hmh. I’ve been taught there’s another way.”

He took the copper wire wound like a tape measure from the box.

“You wrap this around the glass and solder it.”

“Ah,” I said, understanding.

“The solder is melted with the iron and poured into the gap.”

Of course, it can’t be used with glass alone..

In the past, people used elongated rails and copper wire as a frame to glue the glass together. At the time, there was no technology available to make alloys, so they used cheap metals such as lead to fill the gaps. Eventually, their accumulated wisdom gave birth to the mysterious craft of stained glass.

“So the defining feature of stained glass, those lines that separate the fragments, are made from molten metal, then. That really is interesting.”

The boy had a proud look on his face.

I imagined the glass crammed together, lined up in a square frame.

With metal wound around their bodies, they wait for that moment - this moment - to come.

The fragments, created separately,  would never have a reason to fit together usually. But like this, they support each other, able to weather whatever wind blows between them.   .

And then, the moment lead is poured, the gaps fill one after another, and the fragments that were once disconnected are brought together, creating a single picture.

The variety of colors cut from the raw material form the motifs that, when joined, create the completed work. 

I think it's similar to music.

I took the glass on the desk and held it up to the light of the window. The pale red color shined brilliantly.

  

I noticed that there was one more door in the back. When I put my hand on the doorknob, the boy stopped me, saying, “I’ve been told not to go in there.  It's just a storeroom.”

“Okay, if that's the case then,” I said as I stopped, turning to the boy.

I let go of the doorknob and shifted my gaze to a nearby shelf.

Works made from stained glass, like terrariums, glass panels, lamp shades and accessory cases, were all lined up. 

“Your mom’s a good artist, huh?”

“Hmh, Mom is amazing,” he said.

I imagined what might be on the other side of the door.

  

The boy took me to the front entrance and I left.

He told me to go ahead, so I walked down the hallway towards the building exit.

While walking down the hallway, I stole a glance behind me.

After locking the door, the boy thrust his hand into the mailbox in the door. The key was no longer in his hands. There wasn't a sound of something falling, either. Most places have a hook for the key. “Not very careful at all,” I muttered. Anyone could just push it in..

Even now, I can’t stop making that type of analysis. It’s a bad habit of mine.

I remember about a particular day.

I was in the middle of work in my room when I heard the doorbell.

I didn't expect any visitors that day.

When I opened the door, the boy was standing there.

I sighed.

“How did you find this place?”

“I saw you go in here the other day.”

I remembered that the glass studio I visited the other day was only a few alleys over.

Rookie mistake, I grumbled..

“I'm working, go home.”

“You said you'd show me your job next time.”

“I said that?”

“You did.”

I could hear that the boy's voice was wavering a bit.

Despite that, he had a look on his face like he could endure anything.

“You want to see that badly?” I asked.

He looked down.

“Well, I suppose a little while wouldn’t hurt,” I said

I opened the door wide and motioned him in with a nod.

I saw the boy take off his shoes and close the door.

I could hear the small sound of the boy sniffing the air.

“What is that?”

In front of the boy’s line of sight was a large tear-shaped instrument leaning against the wall.

“A lute,” I said.

“Lute,” the boy repeated to confirm

“It has 16 strings. It was a popular instrument in the Renaissance.”

“A musical instrument?”

“Yeah. You know what a guitar is? It's a relative”

“It does look kind of like it.”

To be precise, it was a baroque lute, an improvement from the lutes made in the renaissance. The path the strings follow is called a course. Basically, two large and small strings are stretched except for one course on the treble side. This baroque lute has thirteen courses and twenty-four strings.

Silvius Leopold Weiss, Ottorino Respighi, and Bach have all composed songs for lute.

“There's also a flute,” the boy said, pointing to a shelf near the front door.

“That's a quena, a South American flute”

It's a woodwind instrument from the Andes. It has a similar structure to the Japanese shakuhachi and is often used in folklore.

“Do you make music, old man?”

“Sure do.”

I lightly tapped a handpan next to the quena. A soft, pitched metallic sound echoed through the corridor. 

“Is playing your job?”

“It's part of it,” I said.

One side of the corridor leading to my work room was akin to a storeroom. The instruments and works of art I had collected were all lined up narrowly. 

The boy walked behind me, looking at everything curiously..

We crossed through the corridor into a room..

“Is this where you work?”

Directly in front of us was a couch and a coffee table.

In the back was a long desk and a chair, along with an upright piano and an old guitar, and various other things that were squeezed into the gaps. The tapestry I bought at the store the other day was hung next to a shelf.

I sat the boy down on the guest sofa and headed to the kitchen on the corridor side.

I retrieved the sweets I bring out for guests from the back of a shelf and lit a small pot of water.

I put hot water in a teapot to warm it up, then poured it down the drain before putting the tea leaves in.

I poured in the boiling water and covered it to let it sit for a bit, then I poured it into cups through a strainer.

I placed a couple pastries on a wooden plate.

I brought the tea and pastries to the table in front of the sofa. The boy was giving curious looks as he scanned the room.

“Has school already started?” I asked while sitting down on the small stool next to the sofa.

“Hmh.” the boy muttered, “I was just on my way home.”

“Makes sense.”

Next to the boy was a school backpack.

Sitting there, the boy chatted, bit by bit, about his school life.

How, after spring break, a new school term started. How his school was a little ways away from the multi tenant building. How he was separated from his friends by the new class assignments.   

Along the way, there were several moments where I felt the boy struggled with his words.

“Is there something wrong?” I asked.

“Something?”

“At school. Do you hate it or something?”

The boy looked down.

“Not really. It's not a big deal.”

Despite being a child, he was very grown up, I thought to myself.

“When I was your age, I thought a lot of big deals weren’t very big deals.”

“Like what?”

“Getting poked, being talked about behind my back, and so on.”

“Why do people do things like that?”

“Human beings are afraid of things that are different than themselves. I always found the differences easier to understand than most. In part cause I’ve always had this personality, but yeah,” 

I continued, “I didn’t have a mom. My family was only my dad.”

One day, the meanest guy at school figured that out. In hindsight, it didn’t matter what the reason was to him, as long as it was something different. .

From then on it was a battle. I also didn’t give up easily. And then…”

I paused the story and sipped some tea.

“What then?”

“Finally, I hit the guy, my dad came to school, and that's the end of it.”

“The end?”

“No one involved themselves with me from then on, and I returned to a peaceful life.”

I was glad that happened. My relationships became a clean slate. It's a beautiful moment when something breaks like that. Even more so when it involves yourself.

“Were you lonely?”

“Not at all. That’s just the kind of person I am.

“Hmm,” the boy said.

I stole a sideways glance at his expression.

“I'm the opposite. I have a mom and don’t have a dad. Thats why, well, I don't really know, but…”

The boy shifted his gaze to the outside of the window as he spoke. The sun had begun to set.

“If something similar happened to me, I don't know what I'd do. I wouldn’t want to get beat up all the time. I think that’d make me really sad.

“What if they teased you?” I asked, “You could hit them.”

“I can't do that. I’d feel bad hurting them..”

“Then don’t go to school.”

“Is that okay?”

“If you really don't want to go, that's fine. If there's someone you don't like, not going to school until next year when they're gone is ok. There's no value in doing something that wears down your heart.”

“But if I don't go, mom will be annoyed.”

“I see.”

I thought for a bit. The red of the sunset shone through the gaps between the buildings.

“Do you want to touch it?”

“Huh?”

“The piano, over there.”

I beckoned the boy over to sit in front of the upright piano in the corner of the room.

“Have you ever played?” I asked. The boy shook his head

“Use your finger to press the keyboard. With just a press, it makes a sound.”

Looking puzzled, the boy pressed a key.

A note reverberated throughout the room.

“That’s ‘A.' ‘La.'”

“I know. It's ‘Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do.’”

“You're pretty smart. What sort of image do you have of ‘La?’”

“Hmmm. A pretty sound?”

“That's a nice way of putting it.”

The boy looked at me.

“Do you remember what you said before?”

“A pretty sound?”

“Before that.”

“‘Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do?’”

“That's it. Everything has a name, so of course ‘Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do’ does too. It’s the C major scale.”

“Scale?”

“Like stairs of notes.”

“There's stairs?”

“There are, can you see them?”

“No.”

I placed my hands down from his side.

“‘Do’ is the first stair.”

The key sank down, a shadow cast on it like there was a stair there.

“‘Re’ is the second stair, ‘Mi’ is the third…”

With each step, sound played throughout the room. The boy followed my finger with his eyes.

“After you climb the stairs for a while, you get to ‘La’ at the sixth step.”

I played ‘Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do’ up the keyboard all connected. 

“This is the sound of a scale. You can imagine it in your head. ‘Do’ is the first step, ’Re’ is the second… Can you see the stairs?”

“Hmh, a tiny bit.”

“When I was climbing the stairs, you felt that ‘La’ was a pretty sound?”

“Hmh.”

“But, there are a variety of ways of looking at things. You can start from ‘Do, Re, Mi’, but there are other stairs too.”

I moved my finger up, a shadow was cast on the keyboard.

“For example, we, of course, can start at ‘La.' Let’s try going one-by-one like this. The same way as ‘Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do’.”

‘La, Ti, Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La’ played out.

“When you hear the ‘La,’ what does it sound like now?”

The boy opened his eyes wide.

“It has a lonely sound to it? Did you use different sounds?”

“Well, you see, I’m certain these are all the same sounds. All that's changed is the order. The notes that I played are the same.”

To be exact, it's not just ‘La.’ The sound of the entire scale makes people feel that way.

“It’s a minor scale. Generally, it's a darker sequence of sounds. You said it sounds lonely, but everyone hears it differently. For instance, this staircase sounds angry to me.”

The boy looked at “La” with interest. The lady that changes her countless expressions from one note to the next sprawls out leisurely on the top of the world of 88 keys. 

“There's a lot of ways of looking at things.”

I pressed down some keys. A G chord played. A major with brightness. I continued. G minor. Minor triads, dark minor sounds.

“It's the same with you. Don't take crap from those who don't care about you. Change your perspective. They're probably all jealous of you, poor guys. I get it, though. You're smarter than your age.”

He also had the courage to steal things. A bad courage, but there's a lot of ways of looking at things.

“Only ever look ahead.”

The only thing I remember, my father's words.

“Hmh,” the boy said.

Night had come.

- Solfege is fixed into specific notes in many countries. In the Japanese interpretation of western music theory which would be the one here, la is always A. It's not the same in America where solfege is dependent on root positions in a scale not key. Solfege notes will be translated directly without American interpretation. I swear i'm not British, it's just easier.
# Eight
I remember.

Ever since that day, my daily life changed a bit.

The pattern of my life and job and such didn't change, but the boy would frequently visit my office. On the way home from school. At daytime on holidays. On days off of school in the morning.

When he was free, he would come over with his bag. There were study supplies and other miscellaneous items inside it. It seemed that he was telling his mom he was hanging out with his friends as an excuse, and then coming over here instead.

The boy had one goal: The piano.

He seemed interested in all the instruments in my room and the works of art I made, but the piano, especially, interested him.

“It sounds like a suzu,” he would say.[[#^2]]

There are musicians that compare it to a bell, but a suzu, specifically, is interesting.

When I praised him, linking his sharp sensibility to his creative ability, he laughed shyly.

Other than when I was using it, I let the boy play whatever he wanted. I taught him how to play when I had the time.

Teaching the boy, who enthusiastically came to learn piano, became almost an everyday thing for me. When I was busy, he’d sit on the sofa doing his homework, waiting for the sun to set.

At one point, I told him my family story.

He had asked about it after seeing a picture of my wife on the shelf.

After listening to my wife's story, he asked about what kind of person my dad was.

“He was a jerk,” I answered.

My father was the picture of arrogance. He thought he was the center of the world.

It's no wonder that I, his son, ended up like this.

“You're pretty nice though, old man,” The boy said, stretching out his hand to take a cookie from the table.

While he was gnawing on the cookie, a piece of it fell out of his mouth onto a white key.

“Try not to spill,” I said, and blew the fallen cookie crumbs off of the keyboard. The pieces scattered away in all directions.

The boy laughed like he was being tickled.

> “I returned to burglary.

I’m sure that I’m destined to die a crappy death eventually. But as long as this small person I am is satisfied, then that’s fine. No matter how much trouble I cause to people in this world, it doesn’t matter to me. As long as you eat living things, and live by stealing life, then you’re destined for hell anyway.
> 
>   
> 
> I stole. I continued to steal. I was a thief that stole things. Of course, I saved up money. As long as you have enough,, you can make an identity. I also found a place to live. I was no longer hungry.
> 
> However, contrary to the desire to be satisfied, there was always a feeling of hunger that could not be satisfied no matter how far I went. I continued to burglarize again to fill it.”

At one point, I taught the boy how to read sheet music.

I started with the treble clefs, notes, rests, the positions of ‘Do, Re Mi,’ then simple repeating rules.

The staff notation I bought from the local music store was consumed for writing practice and disappeared to scraps.

“It's like a snail shell,” the boy complained while tracing the bass clef.

“I see, isn't that a good thing?”

“I hate snails and I hate studying.”

The boy began to pout.

I put the magazine I was reading down on the sofa and I looked over sideways at him.

“Well, I guess I also hated that.”

“Why do I have to do this?”

“Study? Or sheet music?”

“No, both”

The edges of the magazine swayed in the wind coming through the open window. I could hear the sound of an airplane far in the distance.

“You'll be able to do more things. If you can read music, you can play instruments.”

“And studying?”

“If you can do arithmetic, maybe you'll become a scholar.”

“Japanese?”

“You can become an author.”

“English?”

Because of the sound of the airplane, the nearby Tachikawa Airfield came to mind.

“You can become a pilot.”

“Wait, really?”

“Foreigners also ride planes, so English is a must.”

The boy gave an affirmative response.

“Right now, the more you study, the more options you'll have in the future.”

“But you said it's okay not to go to school the other day.”

“I only said that not going won't be the end of your life. If you want to become something, or have a dream, you ought to go.”

The boy gazed at the piano lid, his eyes slightly moist.

“I don't really want to be anything.”

“I see.”

I closed the magazine.

“Well, if you want to play the piano, you have no excuse not to know how to read at least a little sheet music.”

While sitting at the desk, the boy stretched out his hand and touched the piano.

The sound of a keystroke rang throughout the room. 

A clean F tone reverberated.

Even if I can’t read, sound will still come out, he seemed to protest in that act.

I stood up from the sofa. I walked to a shelf near the piano.

“Would you like to play something new?”

“Huh, really?”

The boy happily left his seat and sat back in front of the piano.

“What do you want to do?”

“Anything’s fine.”

Do, do, sol, sol, la, la, so, — the sound played out.

“Isn't that ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star!?’”

While listening to the boy's words, I opened a cupboard on the wall. Countless staff notations I collected were haphazardly organized and put on the few boards that were originally supposed to be a bookshelf. This corner of the shelf was used as a sheet music compartment.

While flipping through the disorganized music, I thought.

Which song is easy for beginners to play?

I could hear the voices of children running down the street through the window.

Outside, I could see that the sky had cleared up, and it had become pleasantly sunny.

From behind, the melody of “Le Coucou” played.

Probably because I was looking around so carelessly, a few sheets of music fell from the shelves. They fluttered down like leaves falling from a tree.

The boy quickly reached down to grab them but slipped and crashed on the floor. 

“They fell,” he said.

“I'll pick it up later,” I responded and rolled up some papers.

The farther I dug into the papers, the more music I played in the past appeared.

The history of my music, piled thickly in layers like strata, brought me further into the past with every centimeter I unearthed.

Some had turned light brown, old as fossils. Only natural as it'd been ten years since I made this room my office.

The layers were divided into various genres, from pop to rock, to R&B, but I was looking for a classical piano score. From Chopin to Satie, the unorganized sheet music I had collected was like a classical trade fair.

I heard the sound of paper rustling from where the boy was.

“What’s this?”

I looked over and saw that he had picked up something I’d dropped on the floor. He was holding an old piece of paper that looked as if it was about to disintegrate. It was not only lightly soiled and discolored, but all four sides were horribly tattered.

I took the sheet from him and sighed without thinking.

“How nostalgic, it’s ‘Moonlight Sonata.’”

“Moonlight So-not-uh?”

“I played it when I first started playing piano, too.”

On the end of the paper, something was written. Horizontal characters that looked like they were messed up with a pen. 

Her initials.

“I got this sheet from my wife a long time ago. It seems like it’s still around, huh?”

I noticed the boy was looking at it from the side.

“What kind of song is it?”

“Wanna listen to it?”

I moved the boy off of the seat and sat down in front of the piano

Then, while looking at the sheet music, I played the first dozen or so bars for him.

“You probably know this already.”

“Yeah, I’ve heard it before.”

“It's Beethoven. A famous musician from long ago.”

“He's displayed in the music room.”

“Ah, right, the music room.”

The music room. What a nostalgic sound.

“I want to play this,” The boy said after thinking a little.

About to stand up with the sheet music, his declaration surprised me, leaving me momentarily at a loss for words.

“That’s unexpected. It’s a pretty dark song.”

The boy nodded, seeming not to mind.

“Well, up to that point it doesn’t seem that hard, so I think I can do it.”

I thought for a bit.

“No good?” he said.

“No, it's fine. It's great that you have a song you want to play,” I said. “Just reading and writing is no fun at all, is it?” 

I put the paper back on the music stand and tapped the boy's shoulder.

“Yay!” The boy said, scrambling excitedly back onto the seat.

He stared at the sheet music with a remarkably serious expression.

Then, he looked at me a little embarrassed and said, “How do I read it?”

- [Suzus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzu) are traditional Japanese instruments almost like jingle bells. ^2
# Nine
To that boy who was brimming with curiosity, there were a lot of interesting things besides the piano.

From the corridor into the room itself, the office had plenty of artwork.

From clay sculptures, abstract paintings on canvas, wooden miniatures, lacquerware, woodblock prints, chigiri-e images, to landscape photographs.

To fill in the spaces, there was a contrabass, a violin, some drums, and traditional instruments. On the west side of the room, I put my work desk; right beside it, at the central portion of the room, was the upright piano from before.

“There’s a lot of weird stuff around here,” said the boy.

A great deal of that “weird stuff” around the room was my own work.

For example, Night Sakura.

It was a woodblock print made from sakura wood, depicting blossoms at Shichijō in Kyoto.

Smoke on the Spring Mountain.

A painting of a silhouette of mountains against the vermilion canvas and a single wisp of smoke, its motif was taken from Ozaki Hōsai’s final years.

Plate of Salmon.[[#^3]]

An Arita platter, depicting salmon swimming in a pond. It’s boring to see koi everywhere. What everyone else avoids[[#^3]] is good in its own right.

Of all the work I did, the boy only showed interest at Hole.

  

Hole was a sculpture I made by carving out a hardcover book.

On the outside, it only looks like an ordinary book.

When you open it, however, you see that all the pages have a rectangular hole.

  

“Why does this one have a hole?”

Sitting on the couch, the boy held Hole as he casually stretched out his legs.

Rain was falling right outside the window. I could hear the sound of large raindrops falling around the neighborhood.

“Well, I wonder…” I said.

I was on my work desk, in the middle of writing the invoice for the work I finished the other day.

“Aww,” the boy groaned.

The rain showed no sign of stopping. Nothing else could be heard, other than the sound of cars whizzing along the road from time to time.

“Did you make this?”

“Yeah,” I answered without looking.

“Then, this should have something on it, too.”

The week before, the boy was holding a statue of a Wisdom King.

It was split into two right in the middle, and between the two parts, there was another small statue.

If it were the same Buddhism that greedily took in the gods of indigenous cultures, then having a different god on the inside would not be out of place. That was the idea I was going for. But, as I didn’t have the skill of a dedicated Buddhist image maker, the statue gave the impression of an unrefined god no matter how much I shaved the wood.

Was the boy gladly peeking into it supposed to be my only consolation for making it?

“Ooh, I wonder if something’s written on it.”

He turned the book over, and over, and over. Without looking, I spoke.

“Sorry, but there’s nothing written on it.”

“Nothing?”

“Nothing.”

He put the book on the table in front of the couch.

I put down my pen, and turned to face him.

“What kind of book do you think it is?”

“There’s nothing written in it, so I dunno.”

“No, no. I was talking about what it’s used for.”

The boy cocked his head to one side.

Just like that, I opened the book again. The pages had a hole in the middle, as if it were blown through from below. It looked like the mouth of a monster to me. A monster crudely named “Blank.”

“Ah, I get it. A container?”

“Correct.”

I told myself to take a break, and got up. I grabbed the sweets on the shelf and put them into a wooden bowl on the table.

“Have you put anything in here before?”

“Nope, never have..”

With that answer, I sat on the stool beside the couch.

“It’s important that I don’t put anything in it.”

The boy shook his head, his face saying “I still don’t understand.”

“Why? It is a container, so why not?”

I heard the rain.

“Its name is Hole, right? If you put something in it, then it wouldn’t be a hole. That’s why.”

He closed the book shut, its contents no longer visible. Hole was once again an ordinary book.

“It’s a container you can’t put anything in.”

The boy had a puzzled look on his face.

“Is that still a container? Isn’t it a container because you put stuff in it?”

“In a way, you’re right. Do you call a container a container so you can put things in it? Or is it the other way around? It’s probably a container from the very start if it can contain something.”

I opened the book again, the hole in the middle visible.

“Since you can’t put anything in here, what would this be?”

The boy let out a sigh.

“This is too hard, old man.”

“Well, that’s the point. It’s the sort of work that’s supposed to be difficult.”

I closed the book again, and gave the cover a knock.

  

I thought about it. What could I put in here?

When the “blank” disappears, what would I feel, what would I be ending?

The boy looked at Hole attentively, and asked me something.

“What made you think about making this?”

“Hm?”

“I mean, you made a lot of stuff like this, old man.”

“That’s—huh, I wonder…”

I pondered over it for a bit, and I answered.

“It’s the same reason why I started making music, I guess.”

“Music? Oh yeah, when did you start playing the piano?”

As I listened to the boy talk, I kept looking for that reason.

“I was past 20 when I started playing. I started making music around then, too.”

“Oh, I see.”

As I traced my steps on the path I’d taken for the last ten or so years, I kept thinking.

Then I remembered.

“Making music, doing crafts—I did them both for the same reason, when I think about it.”

That was it. The core of it had never changed.

“I thought they would satisfy me.”

“‘Satisfy?’”

“Like… how should I put it?”

I drew the glass on the table closer with my finger.

It was a deep and translucent tall glass. I used it in place of a pencil case, so it contained various stationery from pencils and erasers to scissors.

“Have you ever felt like you don’t have something other people do?”

I moved Hole to the side, then I took the tall glass and turned it over, spilling the contents onto the table.

The erasers and pencils rolled over slowly.

Hesitantly, the boy answered.

“A dad…”

“I see. In your case, it's a father, huh?”

“Mhm.”

“Everyone has more than a few things they lack in.”

I placed the glass down on its bottom.

“Looks, talent, friends, money, a home—I don’t think anybody has them altogether.”

As I talked, I placed the glass’ contents back in, one by one.

“Everyone has a hole open somewhere. No matter how much you cram things into it, there will always be some part left unfilled. Only when you become aware of this does the hole begin to fill.”

The pencils and erasers were all in the glass. I pushed the contents of the semi-transparent glass to the sides, cramming them together, and there opened a gap.

The boy looked on.

“People make friends if they don’t have any. They work so they can earn money; they tidy themselves up. They find common ground if they really can’t agree on something. They put things away so they won’t care about them. They try not to think about it. They do anything to fool themselves. That’s how they fill the holes they have, by improvising. It’s the same as a bird trying to fly without even being taught.”

I continued.

“I didn’t know where that hole in me was. I didn’t know what or where it was, or even what was missing to begin with. But the only thing I knew was that there was something I couldn’t get enough of.”

I didn’t have a mother myself, but I didn’t think that was it. I grew up without knowing her anyway, so I didn’t think that was what I lacked.

I didn’t care about how I looked. I didn’t need friends. I never wished for any kind of talent. As for money… I’ve thought whether there was something I couldn’t buy enough of, but the thought vanished when I got to earn some.

There was something I didn’t have enough of, something I lacked. But I just didn’t know what that was.

At that time, I began to play the piano. Through imitation, I got to play the one piece I knew.

I thought that was it. For the first time in my life, in that moment, I felt as if the hole had been filled up.

That feeling disappeared a moment after that, though.”

It was like pouring sand into a cup, I said as an example.

Finally, I hung the stapler on the rim of the glass, and I paused for a moment.

“That’s what I want. I want to be satisfied again. But I don’t know whether it’s because of the melody of the masterpiece I played, or if it’s because of the sensation from playing those notes, or for some other reason. Still, that’s how I started making music, and it’s also connected to how I started making handicrafts. I thought that maybe, I could gain that satisfaction by making something with my own hands. And so I made, and made, and here we are now.”

The boy finally opened his mouth.

“Old man, I really don’t get this.”

“Hey…”

I let out a sigh.

“So, what happened after?”

“What do you mean?”

“The hole, did it disappear?”

“Well, a bit, I guess.”

I lied. First of all, I’ve never felt the least bit satisfied.

Furthermore, I know where the hole in me lies. It’s a large one, carved out on a certain day, at a certain moment.

And, I have in mind what would fulfill me for certain — in the most beautiful way possible.

# Ten
One time, also on a Sunday at noon, I met the boy in a back alley.

A different bag than the one he used for school was on his shoulder and he was next to a garbage bin.

“Are you going to your Mom’s workshop?”

He didn’t notice me approaching him, so when I called out from behind, he tensed his shoulders. But when he turned to look at me, he relaxed.

“What are you doing in this kind of place?” The boy asked.

“Nothing really, my office is around the corner, I just happened to see you on my way there.”

While talking, I looked up at the sky. Even though I was in an alleyway tucked behind a building, the humidity wasn’t much different than the main street. It’d been really hot recently.

“I wonder if mom is working.”

The boy said, looking up like I was. From right below, you could only see the verandas of the rooms.

“When she's working, she doesn’t like being bothered.I think I'll go home today.”

He swung the bag over his shoulder.

“That’s nice of you.”

“No, it’s nothing.”

I lightly tapped the boy's shoulder.

“Well, until next time.”

“Uh...!”

The boy raised his voice to grab my attention.

I stopped and looked back.

“Can I come over today?”

“Yeah, that's fine. Right now?”

“No, I'll go over in a bit.”

“Ok.”

I started to walk away. When I got back to the main street, I saw the boy waving a little.

  

That evening, I heard the front door, which I left unlocked, open.

There was a rattling noise, and then the boy entered the room. I was sitting on a stool next to the sofa, sipping a cup of tea I had made earlier, and reading the newspaper.

“You came,” I said as the boy sat down on the sofa. He took his pens and pencils and homework out of his bag and placed them on the low table. The light shining from the balcony tinted the room a brilliant red.

The boy looked over at the newspaper I was holding and saw the words “International Festival.” 

“It's coming soon, isn't it?” he said.

“Sure is,” I said, closing the newspaper.

“Are you not interested in it?”

“Not really.”

“Everyone in my class is talking about nothing but that.”

“I don't really like sports,” I said, shaking my head.

“That makes sense,” the boy said. “Me too, I like watching them much more. PE is so boring at school.”

“I see.”

“School, huh? How nostalgic” I added on, grumbling.

“Once this homework is finished, let me play the piano,” the boy said.

“Do whatever you want,” I responded.

As the boy was opening his notebook, he seemed to think of something to ask me.

“What were you like when you were a kid, old man?”

“I was a normal kid.”

“Really? But you didn’t have any friends, right?”

“It's not normal to become friends with a lot of people. Aren’t you the same?”

“I do have a few friends, ya know,” the boy protested.

I didn’t respond.

Silence fell upon the room. I turned the page of the newspaper.

I could hear the sound of a pencil on paper.

“Do you like piano, old man?” the boy asked while writing.

“What's this all of a sudden?”

“Uh, an investigation,” the boy stammered out.

“I mean, out of all the instruments you have, you only ever play the piano. The one over there.””

“And?”

“That's why I thought you liked it so much.”

I thought for a bit. On one hand, I was simply used to the piano, but it was certainly true that I had a deep attachment to the instrument itself.

“Well, sure, out of all my instruments, I like piano the best.”

“Hmm,” The boy responded, showing his agreement.

“I'm gonna make you a piano.”

“Hah?”

“You'd be happy if I made you a piano, right?”

“Easy for you to say, but have you thought of how complicated that is?”

“Hmm, well, I’ve already thought that part through.”

I thought to myself.

I wonder if he’d be making origami any time soon.

“Well, you can try, I suppose.”

The boy whistled hoarsely. A poor, faltering rendition of “Moonlight Sonata.”

“I’d also like to become good at piano, too,” the boy said.

  

Little by little, the sun began to set. I could hear a pencil rubbing against a notebook.

The boy's interest shifted to the staircase of sound I had talked about before.

“How come people hear different sounds?”

“You mean the scales?”

“Hmh.”

“Well, it's probably because people's brains are formed differently.”

“Really?”

“Probably.”

“It'd be nice if everyone heard things the same.”

The boy put down his pencil. 

“Wouldn’t it?” I said.

I really think so. How beautiful would it be if everyone had the same values, and could draw a single painting together?

The painting would be endlessly beautiful, vast, and no doubt, horrifyingly boring.

The thinly stretched red of the sunset dyed the outside of the window a deep red.

The boy opened his mouth.

“On Friday, I have music class at school.”

“I see,” I said agreeably, looking towards him.

“Well, ya see, they played ‘Moonlight So-not-uh’ in class and I talked with my teacher about it a lot because I like that song.”

“That’s nice.”

“Hmh.”

The boy lowered his voice as the evening bells chimed outside.[[#^4]]

“But it wasn't very interesting.”

The chimes covered the boy's voice but I could still hear him.

I looked at his eyes.

“The teacher played a tape for us.”

“And then he wanted to hear all of our impressions on it.”

“The teacher asked, ‘What kind of song do you think this is?’”

The boy continued, slowly.

I gave him my attention.

“Everyone called it a scary or sad song.”

“Also, melancholy, dark — always those sorts of impressions.”

“And then it was my turn.”

“‘What do you think?’ they asked.”

“Just like everyone else, I said that I thought it was a sad song.”

The boy spoke almost in a whisper.

“But really, that was wrong.”

“The truth is, I think it's a happy song.”

The boy fidgeted with his hands in his lap.

“Because whenever I play it here, it's always like that.”

I played the melody of “Moonlight Sonata” in my head.

I looked out the window.

> “I started making music. I wasn't satisfied just playing other songs anymore. I revoiced the chords. I rearranged the chords using only the melody. On the opposite end, I rearranged the melody making use of the same chords. I reconstructed and played the music in a lot of ways.
> 
> At one point, I created a song I thought up from scratch based on the basics of music I knew. The finished product was beautiful to me.
> 
> Because I made it, I wanted to show it off to someone. I submitted some of my music to a song competition and they contacted me after a few weeks. I was hired. My music was put on a record sold by a musician. Naturally, I had some money to spend.  It wasn't quite the same as the money I could get from stealing from the rich in one go, but the fact that I was being paid for something I had created tickled me with a sense of satisfaction.
> 
>   
> 
> Work would come, I would write a song, and then someone who heard my music would offer me a job.
> 
> As that happened, I gradually became able to make a living with music
> 
> I knew then that I could write what I thought was a beautiful melody and people would accept it. I guess you could say I developed a taste for it.
> 
> I wanted to write more. I wanted a melody with more of that magical power.
> 
> I asked myself. How do you write a melody that appeals to people? Where does the beauty of the scales in the great songs of the past reside?

> All I could think about was that, day in and day out, as I gobbled up my savings from my days as a burglar.

I remember.

While looking out the window, I spoke to the boy.

“In a place long ago, I saw a certain woman. It was a beautiful night that night, bathed in moonlight after the rain.”

The boy liked the sound of rain.

Classical music was playing from the radio.

“On my way home from work, I heard the sound of a piano through a wall.

There, at the very back of that public building, inside of a small concert hall⁠—she was playing piano while shedding tears.

She was playing a beautiful rendition of “Moonlight Sonata.”

Yes, that was it.

“Moonlight Sonata.” Piano Sonata No. 14. 

A masterpiece made by Beethoven.

It was simply beautiful. If it were in the right place, her performance would have been called a masterpiece. 

  

From then on, I thought like a man possessed.

I was caught on the beauty of that  music.

Or, perhaps you could say it was the beauty of the melody. When, where, and how it was conceived. 

For example, was it made when “Moonlight Sonata” was thought up by Beethoven in 1801, or when he put it down on a score? Was it conceived the moment he played it on the piano?

If so, we will never know its true beauty. Even the sound we’re listening to now is not Beethoven's sound -it's someone else's. It’s a knock off.

 Even still, I thought that that woman’s playing was beautiful.

Her “Moonlight Sonata” was, so to speak, a counterfeit. Not genuine. A stolen item. And if that's the case, then even I should be able to do it. If the performance doesn’t have to be what the creator intended, if the melody by itself already has beauty dwelling within it - then it should still remain beautiful, even if I’m the one playing it.”

And, even if I were to incorporate it into my song, it should still remain that way.

The boy was listening quietly, his light brown eyes shining.

“I wonder if it’d be the same if I played it.”

“Of course. That should be the case.”

I stood up from the sofa and felt around the shelf.

I took out a few stained pieces of sheet music and placed them on the music stand.

The boy sat on the piano stool.

I counted off with the fingers I left on top of the music stand.

The boy started to press the keys down — slightly-off rhythm, but resolute.

After listening to his performance for a while, I reached for the recorder on my desk.

The rising moon began shining behind the window. He played the piece again.

I pressed record, and the cassette tape began to spin.

> The moon was beautiful that night. I decided to casually drop by the public building, but when I heard sound through the wall, I knew it was her.
> 
> She was bewildered by the strange listener who suddenly opened the door.
> 
> I had walked in there so confidently, caught up in the moment,, but when I actually stood there, I didn’t know what to say.
> 
> The moonlight illuminated our faces, and it was only then, for the first time, that I could see her face.
> 
> I’ve seen it before, I thought.
> 
> I think she had the same expression I did, back then.
> 
>   
> 
> The first time I met my wife was when I had just moved up to elementary school.
> 
> She was seven years older than me, so how did it start? Well, it was a long time ago, so I'm not entirely certain, but I'm fairly sure it was because of the bus stop near her grandmother’s house. I had cram school in the neighborhood, and she used it frequently to return home from her grandmother’s. We met there.
> 
> She was about to enter middle school. In comparison to that, I was basically still a kid. Still, as we waited for the bus, I don’t know how, but we somehow hit it off well enough that you couldn’t even tell it was the first time we met. 
> 
> She believed in rebirth,and she’d often talk about how we might have been together in a previous life, too.
> 
> She was the only person I could call a friend. Even so, we hadn’t been in contact since she moved to Tokyo for university. So, when we met in a place like that, in those circumstances, she was just as surprised as I was. 
> 
> Just like that, we came to meet again.
> 
> I went to the public building to have her teach me piano.
> 
> I don't know the reason she had for going.
> 
> In the late evening on weekdays, we'd just talk in that hall that few people ever used, playing the piano.
> 
> Whenever I told the story about “Moonlight Sonata,” she’d get embarrassed.
> 
>   
> 
> When I play it, tears come out, she would say.
> 
> “I don’t know why, but tears come out.
> 
> I taught myself piano, so nobody ever taught me, but it feels like I was taught this song by someone.
> 
> The melody to ‘Moonlight Sonata’ just smells like that - do you think that’s strange for me to say?”
> 
>   
> 
> I didn’t think so.
> 
> For a long time, I’d been thinking the exact same thing.

It was the end of the rainy season.

The days had become hot. From outside the window, the evening chimes marked the beginning of the night.

“It’s time,” I said.

When I put my pen down on my desk and turned around, I could see the boy was lying on the sofa, sleeping.

I shook the boy's shoulder and told him to wake up

He woke up drowsily and rubbed his eyes.

“Go home before night comes.”

I said it as usual, gathering up his notebook and the pencils scattered on the table.

I had the boy put the bag on his back and head for the door.

As I pushed him forward, he started to speak.

“Next time,” the boy asked, “Next time, can my mom come too?”

I was at a loss for words.

“For what purpose?”

“My mom. She likes piano. I saw her listening in the living room the other day.”

“What does that have to do with it?”

We continued down the spiral staircase of the building.

The boy continued, the sleep still in his voice.

“I think you’d get along.”

“I don’t really want to ‘get along.’ I’m busy with work, for one.”

I watched the boy descend the stairs.

“What are you looking for in me? I can't do anything for you.”

“You can do a lot of things. You teach me things like piano.”

“Plenty of people besides me can do that.”

While leaving the building and heading to the main street, the back-and-forth continued.

It was only at times like that that the boy would push so strongly.

“But, Old man, you’re —”

I interrupted the boy’s words several times.

We were getting to the end of the street.

“I get it, I get it.”

I breathed a sigh.

“I’ll think about it.”

“Yay!” the boy said, bouncing as he did. “Until next time,” he called, as he took off running down the street.

I watched him run.

The setting sun shined through the gap between buildings.

I knew what the boy was looking for in me. He saw the shadow of a father in me, a kind which I’d never seen for myself.

And yet, at the same time, I recognized what that was.

A callous, but still caring presence.

I, too, could see the image of the ideal father I was looking for in my interactions with the boy.

“You’ve gotten too close,” I blurted out.

I knew it was time to move on.

Night was falling on the city.

> “After we dated for a while, we got married.
> 
> After that, we were always together.
> 
> She was a kind person. Almost too good of a person to be wasted on me. I don’t believe in things like past lives or reincarnation. But when I ran into her again as an adult in that public building in Tokyo, I couldn’t help but to think it was definitely fate.

> It was a happy life with her.
> 
> I thought I'd be with her for the rest of my life, but then, one day, she died.
> 
> Well, it's a common story, one that can be found anywhere.
> 
> I liked to spend time on the office balcony with her, talking about old times.
> 
> We often talked about the fireworks we went to see when we were kids. It was a local festival, held at the end of summer in the next town over. It wasn't as big as in Tokyo, but it was once a year, and there was always a decent amount of people there.

> White flowers were blooming, mixed in among the summer grass. She identified the flowers as anemones, but I said she was wrong — those only bloom in the spring.
> 
> No, I’m sure they’re anemones (ichirinsou), she said. Another name for anemones is “ichigesou,” which is written in kanji as “one-summer-grass” and read that way. She added that it was cold on the mountains a little ways up, so maybe even spring flowers could bloom in the summer. I didn’t have much interest in flowers, and I couldn’t tell them apart, so even though I thought something was wrong, I didn’t have the knowledge to say anything back. Later, I looked it up. I found out that anemones really did have an alias written as “one-summer-grass” that was read as“ichigesou.“I was strangely convinced so I misunderstood for a while, but I eventually understood. The word for anemone was originally “a single flower (ichirin no hana).” That was changed to “single-flower grass (ichirinsou).” And then, there’s an alternate name pronounced “ichigesou” written with the characters for “one,” “flower,” and “grass,” but further transformed by an alternate spelling using “one” and “summer-grass” instead. That’s probably more-of-less the real reason why it’s written that way.

> After all, anemone flowers don’t bloom in the summer.

I remember.

While returning home from visiting my wife’s grave, the rainy season in Tokyo was clearing up and summer was coming in.

When I exited the south side of the station, I saw a small puddle of water on the road at the bottom of the stairs.

I walked through the city after the rain.

Quite soon, the song I made would be released to the public.

It's a piece of contemporary music that would fit a festival. I carefully rearranged the classics to make it. Even my uptight client received it well. When it reaches an audience, it will definitely be the talk of the town.

I am well aware of the beauty of music.

I've always had a soft spot for beautiful melodies.

The musical knock off that I elaborately crafted will reach even the deepest parts of the people’s eardrums – and then after that, I know that I will finally find myself satisfied.

  

After I turned the corner into the shopping district, I found a familiar figure.

The boy was walking alone in the district, deftly avoiding puddles.

While watching his figure from a distance, I walked down the street.

The boy opened the door of the general store I had seen him at before and went inside.

I crossed the street and stopped in front of the store.

I could hear classical music from a gap in the door. Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition Part 1, “Promenade.” It was originally arranged for piano, but the famous introduction melody is beautiful in any form.

I looked at what the boy had in his hands.

I was able to see him through the show window.

The boy was looking at glasswork.

He was holding a piece that combined colors in a patchwork pattern. It had a color scheme that almost looked like stained glass.

The boy left the store and once again went through the shopping district. It seemed he was heading back to the back alley by the multi-tenant building.

Arriving near the emergency stairs, he crouched in front of a nearby trash can.

Then, he thrust his hand into the back of the can, and proceeded to pull things from it and transfer them into his bag, one after the other.

The boy opened the door leading to the emergency stairs and entered the building.

I saw it all.

  

“It’s been a while, hasn't it?” I said.

A few minutes later, where the garbage can sat in the back alley, pieces of colored glass were scattered at the boy’s feet.

Red, blue, emerald green - all dull, transparent colors. 

“Long time no see.”

The boy had an awkward smile on his face.

The bag hanging on his shoulder was full.

“I'm remembering the first time we met.”

“Hmh.” The boy nodded.

“Wasn't it around here? I found glass scattered, right in this back alley. There were multicolored shards.

And then, the emergency exit opened, and you came out. You had an awkward look on your face, just like you do now.”

I remember.

“When I think about it now, there’s something I realize with just a little bit of thought, though.. It wasn't stained glass that you dropped, back then..”

The boy’s voice lowered a bit.

“Why do you think that?”

“There wasn’t any metal wire, was there?” I pointed to the glass on the ground.

That day, there were pieces of glass scattered in the same way..

Any work of stained glass will have metal wires passing through the joints.

If you had dropped one of your mother's pieces, the glass-to-glass outline would be lying there, visible.

“Hmh.”

“The second time we met was at that general store.”

The Gymnopedies were playing. He had taken a glass rabbit piece; I remember giving it to the boy.

“I was just stopping by on my walk, but you seemed familiar with the place. I was jealous of you for having something you liked enough to steal.”

I continued.

“Do you remember what you said before? I’m pretty sure it was, ‘My mom is off work on Sundays?’”

The boy nodded.

“Then, on a Sunday last month, we met here. That time, you said, ‘I wonder if mom’s at work.’ She wasn't at her workshop that day.”

The boy continued to look towards his feet.

I’ve always had a good memory, if nothing else.

“The room behind the door in the workshop isn’t a storeroom either. Is it a room for making glasswork? Like what’s sold at the general store?”

In a magazine I read earlier, I saw an article about a person that seemed to be the boy’s mother. In addition to being a stained glass artist, she was also introduced as a glasswork artist.

Since the day I read about it, I often imagined what might be behind that door. Considering the scale of the stained glass she was making, she would need to have an entirely separate room. Whether it's blown glass or burner work, there was something beyond that door to warrant another room.

"Is there a mallet or something in that bag?"

"How did you know?"

"You’re going to break the glass, aren’t you?"

The boy opened his mouth and spoke.

“Look at it this way, even if it was dropped from the balcony, you can still figure out what it originally was. It would be bad if someone figured out that it was sold somewhere. I have to smash it to pieces with that thing just to be sure.”

I spoke.

“So, in other words, on the weekends, you steal something your mother made to sell at the general store and you break it for fun? And in the midst of all that, you happened to run into me that day.”

The boy didn’t even try to lift his head.

I crouched down and met his eyes.

I was a little stuck for words.

His eyes were a light brown color. Like solid, varnished wood.

They didn’t show emotions.  The color of his eyes reminded me of my wife.

Silence fell over the windless space between buildings.

A distant and quick cicada cry echoed.

I could hear the sound of our breaths.

“Do you hate your mother?”

“That’s not it.”

I thought for a bit.

“Is it revenge for something?”

“No.”

The boy looked away as he denied it.

“Then what is it?”

There was silence.

After a while, he opened his mouth, seeming defeated.

“Because it’s pretty.”

A piece of glass sandwiched between my shoes and the asphalt made a cracking noise.

“Hah?”

“When it breaks…”

“I’m not sure I understand,” I said, then closed my mouth.

“I love my mom, but I hate it.”

The boy said, almost whispering, pointing miserably at the scattered glass at his feet.

“It’s unforgivable,” the boy said.

“I love watching when she makes stained glass.”

I remembered the work room.

“What my mom makes is beautiful; I’m sure it's something only she can do.

For stores, churches, someone's house, all kinds of windows are covered with her glass.

But then, she started making other things.”

I thought. Did it start out as a side business, making glass knick-knacks for the general store?

The days of being able to make a living from stained glass alone must have passed by now. It’s doubtful that a single woman would be able to raise a child on those earnings alone. The fact that she’s not even home on Sundays, she probably has to work a part-time job or something.“So that’s why you broke them?” I said, standing up.

The boy shook his head in desperation.

“At first, I didn't plan to do something like that, I was just watching from the balcony. Because my mom’s glass sparkles when it’s hit by the sun. But at one point, I was looking out the balcony as usual when it slipped out of my fingers, and it fell into the alley,” The boy said.

I imagined it.

The boy standing on the balcony at sunset. Only the hustle and bustle of the main street can be heard from the room of a quiet, multi-tenant building. No one else would be at a workshop on a Sunday.

He would look at the setting sun through the glasswork he took from his mother’s workshop.

The palm-sized rabbit, stained-glass-inspired, with its beautiful, entwined colors reflecting the light.

And then, without thinking, he’d let his finger slide and it would spill from his palm.

And, being pulled by the Earth’s gravity, the rabbit would fall, slowly.

The boy would lean over in a panic, but the rabbit would already be out of his reach.

And then, the moment it hit the ground, the sound would burst out.

And the multicolored glass pieces would bloom, vividly upon the ground.

The boy would find that incredibly pretty.

“So that’s why you break them.”

“Hmh.”

“And you don’t think that's a bad thing?”

“My mom’s in the wrong,” the boy said.

“Even though she makes such amazing things, she does other things cause she wants money. That's definitely wrong.”

He continued, rapid-fire.

“I don't like dirty things. I think it's fine to break things made in a dirty way.”

“Don’t you think that stealing is a dirty thing?”

He went to interject, but was at a loss for words, and kept his mouth shut.

“I didn’t come here to preach to you. What you break and what you steal, it doesn’t matter to me. It's just...” 

I continued. 

“...I’m a bit annoyed, ya know.”

Beneath my feet, the grating sound of glass against the ground could be heard.

“That some people steal almost like they want to be caught.

“To steal from the same store again and again, to deliberately break things near the workshop.”

“Was that the reason you approached a witness like me? You wanted me to get mad at you? Like I’m your guardian or something. I’m afraid I can’t do that for you.”

The boy was silent.

“I’m different than you. My theft has always been cunning; smart.”

I spoke to him.

“Don’t depend on other people. What you do becomes your responsibility. It will definitely come back to you one day.”

I looked at the boy.

A long time ago, back when I was a burglar, that’s what the man who invited me into the lifestyle told me.

With action comes responsibility. We all kill other living beings when we are alive. We step on ants without realising it, we eat other living beings as food. We all sin. All that's left is the size of the crime.

That's why we, at least, try to be aware of what we take.

Certainly, that's how it is.

It was thoroughly wrong, but he thought it wasn’t.

“Well, your mom can’t quit her other jobs besides stained glass. Do you know the reason why her money doesn’t last forever?”

“Eh?”

He finally lifted his head and looked at me.

“It's you, you know.”

My memories of the shop from several months ago came to mind.

“The price of the things you steal are paid for by your mom.”

I shook the boys shoulders.

“Did you really think you wouldn’t be found out? How could the store not check its merchandise. How could your theft go unnoticed so long.  For you to be overlooked.”

When I went back into the store on that day, and was about to pay for the glasswork, the owner spoke to me.

“That kid really is troubled, isn’t he?”

The owner told me he’d already talked to the boy’s mother and would get the amount later.

“You broke what your mom was trying to sell. She has to pay the store for each piece that you break. That’s why she never has enough money. I don’t understand the feelings of a parent who would just let this go on, though.

The boy looked towards his feet again.

“You reap what you sow. Everything you do comes back to you. That's how this world is made. That’s what I believe. Got it? If you’re going to do it, if you want to steal that badly, then do it thoroughly. Think only of how you will be ruined one day, and keep living your life as cunning and sly as possible, and keep causing trouble for others to no end. If you can’t do that, then quit.”

I started heading away without waiting for a response from the boy.

“I’m going now. I have work. It's an important matter. Don’t come over anymore. I’m busy, I don’t have time to babysit.”

Saying that over my shoulder, I headed to the main street.

I never looked back.

> “I found out when my father died. His death was mourned in a small article in the newspaper. It seemed my father had made a bit of a name for himself as a music critic.
> 
> When I returned home to sort things out, I found something on the shelf of his study.
> 
> It was the music I had written. All the records, piled up.
> 
> My dad knew I had become a composer.
> 
> I scattered his ashes to sea.
> 
>   
> 
> Sitting on a sofa in the corner of a room with no one else there, I thought.
> 
> First, about my father. He was an awful human being, but he honestly loved music. I don't know what he was thinking or how he was living when he died, but he died surrounded by music. He must not have been that lonely. I get jealous thinking of it. I start to wonder if I have anything with the same importance.
> 
> I also thought on the thief. His values that never denied crime formed the foundation of his identity. All humans are sinners, unaware thieves that consume life. He affirmed that scramble for life. And so, he stole.
> 
> From a general point-of-view, those are very distorted values, but he held that viewpoint at his core. If you don’t have a heart, then such conviction can never be born. I thought it was just an excuse to justify himself, but now I think he meant it. We're all going to hell someday. He's just deciding how he falls. That’s different from me. 
> 
> I don't have a heart because I've lived my life aimlessly, sometimes just going with the flow.
> 
> I don’t have the type of conviction that comes from the heart.
> 
>   
> 
> I thought about my wife.
> 
> About that day. Memories of summer as a child. Our reunion. Our life together. The park we’d often come across on our walks. The cherry blossoms lining the streets. The phrases she’d say. The beauty of her humming. The mannerisms in the way she moved her fingers. Her hands as she played the piano, her feet as she stepped on the pedal. The depth of her gaze. Her gentle, light brown eyes.
> 
> My head was filled with memories floating to the surface.
> 
> My wife would often say, “If people die at eighty, then it's lonely that I'll only get to spend fifty more springs with you.” I would laugh at that and move on, but that was a mistake. Like she said, her life did end up having a deadline. Whether its senility, illness, or an accident, a person's lifespan is not forever. We all die, eventually. Life has an end.
> 
>   
> 
> I wondered, will I die without leaving anything behind?.
> 
> I have nothing. No convictions. No heart dependent upon them.. There’s nothing I want to do. I'll just vaguely continue to make music and aimlessly earn money. Continue making things.
> 
> Pretend that I’m creating..
> 
> What I’ve created thus far, my musical work, has been an extension of my “pencil case,” if you will.
> 
> A long time ago, I made that pencil case to give to my wife. There was no creative intent, it wasn’t something you could call a creation. It was simply made for her happiness.
> 
> There is nothing in this room I have created of my own will. Everything is for someone else.
> 
> I want something, too.
> 
> For the first time, to create something of my own will, with my own values. To see the scenery that comes from a heart with its own convictions
> 
> A work made of what nobody has expressed before, an original creation.
> 
> I finally started thinking.
> 
> About the beautiful ends to moments that only I could express. I finally started thinking about those times.
> 
>   
> 
> And then, I determined my goal.
> 
> First off, I would resume making music.
> 
> Fortunately, I already had some talent.
> 
> Both as a musician, and as a thief. 
> 
>   
> 
> I made music. Not just something that flowed on aimlessly. Music to be heard, more than just to sell a name, to touch people's hearts. Music as a business.
> 
> My experiences up until then had all been stealing. The method of plagiarism is similar to burglary. You choose a target, examine it carefully, then rob it. Thanks to my father, I had a good ear. I knew the beauty of a melody. 
> 
> The goal isn’t to make music. It’s in stealing that there’s meaning .
> 
>   
> 
> Then, one by one, I created. 
> 
> From out-of-copyright classical, to pop songs that filled the streets, to classic songs of years past, the various music that flowed through the streets, humming, performances - all were recorded, studied, and incorporated. Slyly and meticulously, I recombined them. Sometimes, I added them verbatim. So to speak, I was a music thief.”

After half the month passed by, the intercom rang all of a sudden.

When I opened the door, there stood the boy.

He carried a paper bag for some reason, but he kept his head low.

“I thought I told you to not come back.”

As I spoke, the boy mumbled. I sighed.

“Looks like you still don’t get it, so I’ll say it again. Don’t get involved with me anymore.”

This is finally it, I thought.

“You see, I really don’t like kids. Big words and ideas go past their heads. They get bothered over the silliest of things. Talk with them for too long, and they get dizzy. To me, kids just get in the way of work.”

“Get lost already. Don’t come back here again.”

I shut the door. When I came back into the room, I sank into the couch.

I picked up one of the sweets on the table in front and took in its scent. I’d always hated it.

The entire platter went into the trash can, and for the first time in a while, I lit up a cigarette.

Since then, the intercom rang every few days, but I never answered it again..

The following month, the weekly magazines all began with a single news story.

It was an interview held in the midst of a festive Japan, as that worldwide festival that had taken over the globe had started. It featured a confession from the man who composed the event’s main theme.

“I am a thief.”

From that one sentence, a confession of plagiarism began.

> “I stole. Every single bit of it, piece by piece.
> 
> I stole beautiful sounds and composed something out of them. Then, I palmed off the music I created to someone else.
> 
> Little by little, people began to take notice of my music. My commissions increased, and I even got some media exposure. I kept on creating these high-quality fakes. People have this misconception that the more you see someone’s name, the better their work is. So day by day, I got more and more coverage. Finally, I had people who were starting to call me a “genius,” the “second coming” of someone something-or-other.
> 
> Of course they were.  I did have a knack for thievery. I know what makes a melody beautiful. With just that, I got to where I am now in a matter of years.
> 
>   
> 
> I’ve been waiting for an opportunity. As slimy as a snake, I scoured the whole of society for it. This isn’t enough. This isn’t the right time. This commission won’t do. This moment isn’t it.
> 
>   
> 
> But then, it happened just how I imagined. The moment finally arrived.
> 
> The main theme to a worldwide festival. A request for me to compose it.
> 
> It was a chance I had never had before.. Finally, it fell into my hands, as if it was handed down to me from heaven itself.
> 
> A festival with all the world’s eyes fixed on it. What would happen if the main theme to that event was a work of plagiarism? I thought, surely, beautiful fireworks would light up the sky.
> 
>   
> 
> From then on, I had the thought of creating a work titled “Me,” about the fall of a plagiarist. It was going to be a work no one had ever laid eyes on, something I, and I alone, made.
> 
>   
> 
> From the start, I have always aimed for my own downfall.
> 
> I knew that that was the only, singular way this hole could be filled.
> 
> That’s why I stole.
> 
>   
> 
> How does it feel, Mr. Writer, hearing all this? I have nothing else to talk about. My story ends here.
> 
> Pangs of conscience? Does my heart feel heavy with the thought of having plagiarized?
> 
> Well, absolutely not.
> 
> Someone may have been boasting when they said real composing ended after Bach, but I think it may even be true.
> 
> Even in this very moment, people all over the world are making music.. They’ll make up patterns out of the twelve tones across a number of octaves, and even in this very moment, they will continue to bring melodies forth...
> 
> If that’s the case, then that famous track, that hit song playing on the radio, and even this stylish jazz bop playing right now… it wouldn’t be wrong to say that all of them have already been played at some point in the history of music.
> 
>   
> 
> I may be a second-rate thief, but I’d rather be aware of that than be one of those third-rates speaking of originality with no self-awareness whatsoever.
> 
>   
> 
> Hey, you better write a good feature. Turn me into something that’ll catch a lot of people’s eyes.
> 
> The very moment of an end is beautiful, and much more so if it’s my own. Right now, I’m more-or-less well-known. I worked hard all this time just to get here. Brick by brick, I built myself up. And now, the moment where it all crumbles and falls is soon to follow.
> 
> People will probably curse me to hell and back.
> 
> In this very event, my life as a musician will end, with me smearing dirt across the faces of all the people who helped me get here. I’ll watch all of that, on my own, from the box seat where only I am able to sit.
> 
>   
> 
> Hey, you understand me?
> 
> You don’t, huh? That’s fine. As long as I understand it, that’s okay. It’s within my grasp. At long last, I finally have something of my own that no one else can imitate.
> 
> All the things I lack are within it. That’s really all it is.
> 
>   
> 
> I’ve always waited—lived—just for this, just for this very moment.”
# Fourteen
I opened the front door of my office..

I hadn’t been able to go out for a few days, since then. I would always feel as if I was being watched.

Sunshine, the intensity of late summer heat,  was shining on the corridors of the building. When I tried to lock the door, I found a letter stuck in the mail slot.

“Thief” was written on it.

After peeling the envelope open, I neatly folded the letter and put it in my bag.

  

I walked through the main street, and then headed towards the south entrance of the station.

Then, like always, I sat on the bench in the square, facing the turnstiles. I could hear the sound of crowds, people talking amiably as they walked. A shaved Buddhistdhutanga priest was ringing a bell at the station entrance. 

I don't walk with my recorder anymore. I don't listen to crowds or eavesdrop on conversations. But the habit just won’t disappear. I prepared myself like always, sitting on my homebase bench. All I had was vague free time. 

There was no one left to ask for work.

I saw a familiar little shadow amidst the crowd and lowered my head.

After a little while, I heard the sound of the boy’s voice in front of me.

“Old man.”

I didn’t acknowledge it, and ignored him.

“Old man.”

The boy called out to me a second time. I begrudgingly replied.

“What?”

“Well, y’see...”

I stayed silent. The boy mumbled on, moving his mouth before finally deciding on what he wanted to say.

“Sorry for not telling you sooner. I’m –y’see– I'm moving away. Somewhere far.”

The boy said a place near the southern tip of the country. He told me he was going back to his mother’s hometown.

“I see.”

“My mom said she can't continue her work. Cause glass doesn’t make any money. She said I didn’t need to worry about it.”

The crowd sounded awfully small.

“Even though it’s my fault.”

I was silent.

“Old man.”

The boy said.

“If I come to Tokyo again, can we play together?”

Without answering, I turned my face down.

The melody of “Moonlight Sonata” came to mind.

After a moment, I told the boy:

“Just go.”

The boy's expression was hidden by his hat.

“Okay.”

The boy remained where he was standing in front of me.

Time passed in silence.

  

From the crowd, I heard a voice calling out to the boy.

Just like that day in the back alley, I saw a motherlike figure walking towards us..

I scanned her face and thought that it was similar to the boy’s. She seemed to be the same woman I saw in that lifestyle magazine the other day.

His mother looked at me suspiciously. A few seconds after our eyes met, she made a face as if she realized something.

Probably because she’d seen my face somewhere recently too. Likely in a weekly magazine or a  talk show.

“We’re leaving, let’s go,” the woman said, and hurriedly took the boy’s hand before dragging him off.

“Ah.” I could hear a voice say. It was already far in the distance.

  

After a while, I noticed something was placed right next to where the boy was standing.

It was a small paper bag, sloppily sealed with tape. I understood that it was there to be given to someone. It seemed to be the same paper bag that the boy had when he came to me before. I looked at the back.

“To Old Man” was written on it.

I peeled the tape and looked inside the bag.

With it weighing down on my hand, my palm landed on something heavy..

It was stained glass. Arranged on a rectangle plate.

It was an awkwardly arranged assortment of pieces, with glass in mismatched colors. “Recently, when my mom has free time, she’s been teaching me.”

The boy’s words came to mind.

I turned it over. I didn’t understand what it was at first, but as I looked at it, I realized.

The colored glass on the rectangle plate combined to represent something.

There was a rectangular piece placed in the center. From the bottom of it was another rectangle that may have resembled a foot. The center of the rectangle was made of frosted glass with fine lines, indicating an attempt to recreate a keyboard.

The model for it was probably the upright one in my office. It was a piano.

I stood it up as if about to play it.

I lifted my head. I looked back at my surroundings. Before I walked away, I stopped in place. The boy was already nowhere to be seen. He had finally disappeared into the crowd.

I stood there, dazed for a bit.

After awhile, I set myself back down on the bench.

People passed in front of me. When, rarely, one of them saw my face, they'd walk away quickly, as if startled.

I could hear the chime of bells. Standing inside of the station, a Buddhist priest rang his bell for alms.

As he did, the sun began to set.

The stained glass in my hand glowed dully in the setting sun.

The wind caressed my cheek. I could hear the bell.

The ultramarine of night is slowly descending on the city.

I'm still unable to move.

It smells like summer.

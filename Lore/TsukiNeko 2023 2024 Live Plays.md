# Theater 1 (Prologue): The Painter

---

“The flowers in the vase had withered.”

  

I’m an artist. Specifically a painter. 

  

I’ve been stuck in an artistic slump for a while now. I haven’t been able to think of anything to draw or paint. It’s making my work feel like a stagnant puddle of water.

  

Looking for something to take my mind off of things, I looked out the window of the room, setting aside the white curtains to see the view. There, I saw a small bird fluttering in the sky.

  

Unlike human beings, birds aren’t tied down to work for their lives. I envy their freedom. Free to do whatever they want, whenever they want to. 

  

My works are composed of various landscapes that I visualize and sometimes see with my two eyes. I’m very fond of the possible landscapes that I could make and I would usually draw and paint them.

  

I used to have a clear idea of what I wanted to paint, visualizing them and drawing them per feature before coloring them. But after what she said back then, I haven’t been able to do what I wanted to do. I haven’t been able to see a clear image of what I wanted to make.

  

She criticized them, calling them “boring”. In her opinion, my paintings were only drawn accurately and lacked any “interesting” features.

  

She herself doesn’t paint, but she has a good eye for art.  
  
Especially when looking at landscapes pertaining mostly to nature, since she’s a forestry worker who’s been exposed to those most of the time. She also works as a promoter for artists in the city, planning and organizing exhibitions as well as handling the logistics of it. So her opinions still weigh a lot for me.

  

The more that I recall her words, the more my mind gets clouded. 

The more that my heart aches.

  

I wanted to change my mood. I decided to play the piano to keep my mind from thinking about it. 

  

The place that I’m staying at is a small studio that I’m only renting from the landlord. Being that painting is my work, I have to keep working to stay here. And having no output for a while makes my time shorter here. 

  

After just a few steps, I find myself in the room where the piano is placed. From the bookshelves in the room, I searched for the piece that even an amateur in music can play. It was, after all, the only thing I can play. 

  

“Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 14, Moonlight Sonata” I read the piece’s name as I pulled it out of the shelves.

  

I flip through the piece as I walk towards the piano. Placing the piece on it, I sat down and started to play the piece.

  

As soon as I started to play the introduction of the sonata, I suddenly heard a cat’s meow from somewhere. I stopped for a moment with my hands raised above the piano keys, looking at my surroundings and thinking if I really heard a cat’s meow. 

  

After some time, I couldn’t find any evidence that a cat was in the room with me. I might have imagined it. 

  

I decided to ignore it and continued on playing the piano.
# Theater 2: The Canary

---

On a bright moonlit night, I decided to open my window to get some fresh air. I was still struggling to find my creativity.

  

There was the sound of a bird singing outside. Then suddenly, one yellow bird swooped into the window and stood on the frame.

  

It was a canary with mesmerizing black eyes that reflected the moonlight.

  

I tried to shoo the canary away but it didn’t budge. In fact, it didn’t even move an inch from where it was before. It’s strange, it seems like it’s very familiar with people being around it and doesn’t show any sign of running away when approached. 

  

Then it flew towards the piano in the room and perched itself up on it.

  

Seemingly following its lead, I sat down on the piano and played the usual Moonlight Sonata as a distraction and to my surprise, the canary that hasn’t moved no matter what I did, suddenly spread and flapped its wings.

  

When I stopped playing, the canary also stopped moving and stood still. I waved my hand in front of it, trying to shoo it away once again but it didn’t move. I started to wonder if the canary was still alive.

  

An idea popped up in my mind after what it did earlier. I started to play the keys one by one.

  

The canary suddenly moved when I hit a specific note. A G sound.

  

“I think I’ve finally lost my mind” I thought to myself while slightly smiling.

  

Slowly, I played the notes from the sonata and the canary moved in time along with the piano’s sounds as if it was entranced by it. It was dancing in a strange way while its wings spread from its body. 

  

Seeing this strange phenomenon, I hurriedly picked up my sketchbook to capture this moment. Drawing the canary with its wings spread out.

  

The moment that I finished the sketch, the canary already flew away. Nowhere to be seen in the room.

  
  
  

The following day, I was in deep thought. I moved towards the open window, staring at the seaside scenery outside.  Thinking about the events that transpired yesterday, thinking if it really happened.

  
  

As I look towards the horizon, I imagine those yellow feathers fluttering across the sea.
# Theater 3: The Frog

---

I find myself under a tree with red flowers growing from it. A stag is staring at me. I carefully tried to move and felt an item in my hand.

  

It was a small wooden box.

  

I realized that this was a dream and woke up.

  
  
  

Ever since I was a child, I was more versatile and better at drawing than most people. And for a long time now, I’ve always had a scene that I’ve wanted to paint in my mind. 

  

Scenes that had a road in between and through the trees, a street of a foreign country, churches that seemingly looked exotic blending in the equally exotic cityscape its in, benches spread out. 

  

A café terrace being soaked wet in the rain. 

  

It’s strange, but I can vividly see every single leaf and its details even when I have never seen them before. I wanted to paint them so I could give form to these vivid sceneries in my mind. I went to the canvas to get started on it.

  

Taking a break, I picked up a cigarette and went to the window to smoke. While trying to get a good position on the window frame, I felt something slimy on my palms. I noticed that this slime belonged to a small green frog on the window sill.

  

I waved my hands in front of it to get rid of the frog but it didn’t move.

  

Remembering that this has happened before, I decided to give up and just play the piano for now. 

  

After throwing away the cigarette, I approached the piano. Only to be greeted by the same frog that I saw on the window earlier. I jumped back in surprise. 

  

“Give me a break. The piano’s just a rental from the landlord…” I muttered.

  

I was still puzzled when I suddenly remembered the bird. I sat on the piano and started to play the sonata again and as expected, the frog started to move along with the sound. 

  

It’s the same thing that the canary did before. I was experiencing a sense of déjà vu.

  

Then I stopped playing and tried to play one note at a time, seeing if the frog would respond the same as with the canary. It started to move only when I hit the key for a resounding F.

  

From there, I kept playing one note at a time and the frog complimented it on time, dancing along with the melody while its figure was illuminated by the moonlight.

  

I felt the urge to capture this moment like I did with the canary. I stopped playing to pick up my sketchbook. The frog stopped as well, raising its hands up and posing as if it was dancing a waltz. 

  

I poked the frog to see if it’ll move but it didn’t. 

  

“That’s pretty good, isn’t it?” I thought to myself, looking at the frog’s pose.

  

I quickly sketched the frog onto my sketchbook and after finishing, I picked it up and placed it on the window to let it go. I went to the bathroom afterwards to wash my hands off of the slime. When I returned, the frog was no longer there.

  

Then, I decided to clean up the piano as well. To my surprise, there was another animal on top of the piano. It was a chameleon, with its tails slumped over the keys as if it were playing it.

  

“Is this a zoo or something?” I jokingly said. After all, it’s one of the strangest creatures that you can sometimes only see in a zoo.

  

Expecting it to do the same as the other animals, I started to play the piano for it. While the others danced, this chameleon followed the notes being played with its tail, wobbling as I pressed through the keys.

  

“Why on earth do these animals do these things?” or, to be more frank, “Why do these animals come for the sound of the piano?” 

  

I could only question myself.

  

I stopped playing the piano and started to sketch the motionless chameleon on the piano. It disappears after I finish the sketch.

  

As these events keep transpiring in my life, I started to think that these might be an interesting work of art, if captured well.
# Theater 4: The Phone Call

---

“Your paintings are still not interesting” the voice of my ex-girlfriend rings from the phone.

  

It seems she was pointing out something about my paintings. I started to tell her and describe to her the recent visits of animals in my room, and that was what she said with the paintings that I’ve done to capture those visits.

  

I sighed after the phone call dropped. It seems that nothing has changed since then.

  

Suddenly, I noticed a small ball of fur visible from the window frame. 

  

It was an animal with a brown body and white spots on it, it’s a rabbit. And it seems that it’s asking me to let it inside the room from the window. I ignored the rabbit and went on to play the piano again. 

  

While playing, I keep hearing the rabbit on the exterior wall of the building reacting to the sounds that the piano makes. It’s getting annoying.

  

As I kept going, so did the rabbit. Repeating the same thing over and over again, I end up losing my temper and quickly rush towards the window with my hands raised to “scold” the rabbit.

  

I leaned out the window to scold the rabbit and make it go away. Seeing me, the rabbit stiffens as if waiting for my hands to land on it.

  

Still frustrated, my eyes meet and lock on to the eyes of the landlord who were standing outside the window, unbeknownst to me. I unintentionally forced a smile in an affectionate manner to cover up my frustration (and the upcoming mistake that I would have made if they didn’t show up).

  

After the landlord left, I decided to pick up the rabbit and let it in the room. 

  

As usual, I played the sonata and the rabbit followed. It slowly lifts its paws as if dancing with the sounds of the piano. I sketched the rabbit in the same manner as I did with the other animals and it disappeared after I finished.

  

Then, a thought came to my mind. I think I know a story that’s similar to what's happening to me, with these animals visiting me.

  

But I can’t remember what story it was.
# Theater 5: The Sandy Beach

---

“This time, a bat came to my room, can you believe that?!” 

  
  

I was speaking with my ex-girlfriend on the phone, telling her the most recent visit to my room. All the while still describing the sketches that I made from their visits.

  
  

“That bat… It was upright when it was on the window frame, not upside down. They’re usually upside down right?” I ask her, confused and surprised at the same time.

  

“Uh huh.” her voice answered from the phone.

  
  

She sounded unamused as she didn’t believe any of my stories ever since I told her. She thinks I’m making these up.

  
  

“It looked cool. Standing all gentlemanly and smart.”

  

“Maybe I should go see them sometime? If they always come to your room like you said.”

  
  

I was taken aback when she said this. I struggled to respond to her. 

I haven’t completely cut my attachment to her from myself.

  
  

“They don’t come that often. It just happens.” I replied unintentionally.

  

“Haha, I’m kidding.” she says as she laughed a bit through the phone.

  

“It doesn’t help your case if you say something like that. It’s already hard to believe.” she pointed out and then continued to speak.

  

“Look, I appreciate these works that you’ve made about these encounters that you’ve been having, but I didn’t think you were the kind of person to talk after what happened to us.”

  

“I can’t explain it. I think these events aren’t something that I can keep to myself and you’re the only one that I can think of sharing it with.” I replied.

  
  

Then, a sudden silence engulfs the call. Both sides are silently thinking what their next sentence would be. 

  
  

“You know, your stories make me think that it’s like that one story from Kenji Miyazawa. I read it a long time ago, ‘Gauche the Cellist’ if I remember correctly…” she spoke, breaking the silence.

  
  

It was the story that I was trying to remember. Gauche the Cellist. A short story that covers Gauche, a struggling cellist who gets inspired by animals visiting him, gaining insight into music with every visit. While I know how the story went, which is how I remembered it being similar to my situation right now, I didn’t know how it ended. 

  

While trying to remember how it ended, she interrupted my train of thought with a question.

  
  

“Why don’t you try and become a picture book author?”

  
  

This question caught me off-guard. I know I can draw and paint well but writing words and sentences was never my forte.

  
  

“How could I become a picture book author if I myself can’t write a single sentence?” I replied.

  

“What? Are you still living in the past?” she mockingly asked and then continued.

  

“Nowadays there are ‘picture books’, books that don’t have words written on them and only contain pictures, images to form the story.

  

Pictures are sometimes more eloquent than words.

  

After all, all creations are words, just in a different form.”

  
  

Those words impressed me. I wasn’t expecting her to come up with that.

  
  

“That was really nice, I really liked those words. Did you come up with that or did it come from somewhere else?” I asked her, genuinely wanting to know the answer.

  

“Those were your words. Did you forget about it?”

  
  

I was astonished. I do remember them. Those words were mine, when I still had a passion for creation. 

  
  

“You’ve changed.” she sadly says. 

  
  

Feeling embarrassed, I tried to deflect the conversation to another topic. Returning back to “Gauche the Cellist”.

  
  

“So… How did Gauche the Cellist end?” I asked.

  

“The book that I said before?” 

  

“Yeah. I can’t remember how it ended.”

  

“Ah. That’s…” she says with a change of tone in her voice before stopping for a second.

  

“Gauche regretted his actions against the visiting animals. He didn’t treat them well and was always thinking they were a nuisance to his practice but in the end it was them that helped him get back on track.

  

He wished that he could have been nicer to them from the beginning.”  

  

“I… see.” I replied while contemplating the same acts that I did.

  
  

But suddenly, I realized there was a ting of sarcasm in her words. It’s as if she was trying to tell me that I should’ve been nicer to her as well. Kind of ironic knowing that, after everything that had happened.

  
  

“Well, I think my time is up for today. I’ll see you later.” she says on the phone, giving off a bit of laughter . 

  

“Good night.” She finishes the call with those words.

  
  

We hung up after that. Her words were still lingering in my mind.

  

It made me remember the times we were still together. Saying goodbyes and farewells so commonly, expecting to still see each other later on.

  

It made me remember about our common and mundane breakup. 
# Theater 6: The Deer

---

There’s a sharp, squeaking sound that came from the window. It was midnight.

  

I looked towards the window and saw that it was from an owl. Without even being surprised, I walked towards it. I slowly tried to get close to it to touch it but the more that I got close to it the more that it squinted at me. 

  

It suddenly entered the room through the open window and moved to the piano. It perches on it, not moving a single bit afterwards.

  

Again, I started to play the intro of Moonlight Sonata to see what kind of dance it will do. The owl started spreading its wings in sync with the notes. It was even more majestic than the canary. I sketched the imagery of the owl while its wings are spread as if dancing to a waltz. 

  

Right after the owl disappeared, I was visited by a small winged insect with a large jaw. It looked like some sort of beetle. This time, the beetle danced to the sound by lifting its jaws and opening then closing them in time with the melody. I also sketched its image in my sketchbook and after that, I closed the window to keep insects from coming in.

  

I started to wonder what kind of animal would come next, and as soon as the beetle disappeared, I heard a tapping sound from behind the wall of my room. It was near the window.

  

I looked outside the window and was overwhelmed by the sight of a large stag with magnificent antlers. It was so big that I didn't think I could let it in the room through the window. In fact, no, I CAN’T let it in.

  

The stag, which is a deer, had large antlers and eyes as black and deep as the night. The moonlight reflected off of it, making it slightly shiny when you look at it. For some reason, I feel like I’ve seen this light somewhere before.

  

The deer taps on the window frame, seemingly making itself look like someone knocking on a door, asking for the homeowner to let them in the house. 

  
  

“You know I can’t let you in.”

  
  

I went to the piano after telling it that I can’t let it in. I started to play the piano  to relax myself but the deer kept tapping on the window frame as I played. It was disturbing me. 

  
  

“Give me a break, I need to rest my head in order to create. I don’t think you animals understand that…” I said to the deer, frustratingly.

  
  

I kept playing and it kept tapping. I ignored it and it started to let out a wild cry. I ignored it more, but it just kept going. 

  

When I’ve had enough, I stood up and rushed towards the window with my hands raised, trying to scare it away. But it didn’t budge. I tried to compose myself and “make a compromise” with the deer.

  
  

“Fine, alright! You can listen but I can’t let you in. Just put your head in through the window.” 

  
  

I opened the window and it slowly peered its head in. It was looking at the piano as if it was eagerly waiting for me to play it.

  
  

“You want me to play? I could only play one song though.” I said as I walked back to the piano.

  
  

While the deer was still staring at the direction of the piano, I started playing the intro of the sonata. But there was something different this time.

  

I could play that part of the song without even looking at the keys anymore. It seems I’ve gotten used to it as the animals visited me. 

  

I got so excited that I couldn’t stop myself from playing, I even got up and looked towards the window. I can see the deer moving its mouth, opening and closing it in time to the music. 

  

I finished playing the introduction and took my hands off the piano. I decided to get my sketchbook to draw the deer. After sketching, I noticed that the deer was still there looking at me with its narrowed eyes, as if urging me to keep playing.

  
  

“What? I can’t keep playing. That’s the only part that I know how to play.”

  
  

It squealed, basically begging for more.

  
  

“Okay okay! Don’t squeal too loudly, I’m gonna go back to the piano now okay?” 

  
  

I tried to go back but the deer held on to the window frame making a loud sound.

  
  

“Quiet please! I’ll get kicked out for this if you keep doing it. Just, please stay quiet and I’ll play.”

  
  

I told the deer and left it at the window. I don’t know if it could understand what I’m saying but I said what I wanted to say. The deer kept making noises as I walked towards the piano. I rushed back towards it to try and calm it down.

  

As I told it to calm down, I raised my hand and slowly approached the head of the deer. When I tried to reach for it, the deer suddenly stood frozen in the same position for a while. 

  

Then, I heard a door open from behind me. I stood frozen for a while like the deer, before turning to see the landlord standing there.

  
  

“Oh, uh… Good evening landlord. It’s gotten a lot cooler hasn’t it?” I asked nervously.

  

“Is this the piano that you borrowed?” the landlord says as they look at the piano in the room.

  

“Yes, I’ve been playing it for a change of pace.”

  

“I see. Painting all the time must be getting to you.”

  

“Well, not really. I’m just taking a break, that’s all.”

  

“Ah well, try to tone it down if you’re playing in the middle of the night. The neighbors will get angry at me if you play it loudly.” 

  

“Yes I will! I didn’t mean to play it so loudly!” 

  

“Alright, good night.” 

  

“Thank you very much for understanding!” I said, as the landlord left the room.

  
  

I let out a sigh. I’m relieved that I didn’t get kicked out.

  

I sat down to rest after all that had happened. I can see the sketch of the deer in my sketchbook.

  
  
  

Time passed and suddenly my phone rang. It was a call from my ex.

  
  

“Did you get the pictures that I sent you?” I asked.

  

“Yeah. A canary, a frog, a chameleon, a rabbit, an owl and then… a deer?” She replies with a confused tone.

  

“Good. So I was-” I stopped as she interrupted me.

  

“Wait, wait. The deer came to your room? An entire DEER?” 

  

“Yeah? Well, it didn’t get itself entirely in the room but it did get into my room.”

  

“I- what?”

  

“Look, it peered its head in through the window and that’s it. I’m not lying about this.”

  

“Alright I guess.”

  

“Ok, back to where I was. I was planning on creating a series of paintings with the motif being the ‘Dancing Animals’ that visited me. The first painting would be a human being.”

  

“Why a human being?”

  

“Because human beings are animals too.”

  

“And who’ll be the model?”

  
  

I wasn’t sure how to answer that it would be her. I slurred my words a bit to cover it up.

  
  

“I see…” she replies with a worried tone. 

  
  

Then a few seconds of silence filled the call before it was broken up by her voice.

  
  

“Hey, why don’t you have a solo exhibition with those animals?”

  

“W-What? An exhibition?” I replied with excitement.

  

“Yeah, I’ll organize it. There’s a newly renovated room in a building that I could probably rent up for the exhibition.”

  

“Are you sure about this? Aren’t you busy these days?”

  

“I am. But it’s more fun when I’m busy.”

  

“You-” I stopped.

  
  

I was about to say that she hadn’t changed since then. But I couldn’t muster up the courage to tell her.

  
  

“Hmm?”

  

“Ah, nothing.”

  

“Okay, so are you up for it?” she asks.

  

“Yes I am! I’ll prepare the past sketches for you and bring you the ones that I’ve drawn so far.”

  

“Haha! You haven’t changed a bit.” she says so consciously.

  

“Well, we’ll go over the details in another call. Call me again when you’re ready.”

  

“Okay!”

  

“Alright, see you then.” she hangs up.

  
  

After putting the phone down. I was overjoyed, excited, elated. I gestured my hand and body to say:

  

“Yes. I’m finally going to do it!”

  

I sat down and happily started to paint the sketches.
# Theater 7: The Cat

---

“Please don’t feed them anymore. They keep coming and disturbing the people.” The landlord talks through the phone.

  

“Yes. I’ll avoid feeding them… I’ll be careful next time.” I replied.

  

“Alright, I’ll leave you be then.”

  
  

The phone call hung up.

  
  

“Sigh, seems like I’ll be living a bit harder now. The landlord doesn’t want those animals coming in.” I muttered to myself.

  
  

Finding myself in a stressful situation, I walked towards the piano to relax. But before I could even reach the chair, I heard a sound coming from the window again. 

  

It sounded like a meow of a cat. I opened the window and tried to look for a cat but there wasn’t anything there. I kept the windows open and turned back to my piano, only to see a black cat had already gotten inside my room.

  

It was strange seeing this cat. It was bright because the moonlight that reflected from the mirror shone on it, making its fur look like it was shining.

  

Knowing that the cat was here for the music, I went to the piano and started to play the sonata as usual. This cat was different from the others. It seemed like this cat didn’t stop if you stopped playing.

  

The cat wandered around the room for a bit while I played the piano and then it sat up on the piano just right after I finished playing the introduction part.

  

The cat looked at me with its black eyes as I stopped playing, like it was waiting for me to say something to it. I raised my hands from the piano and put it on my lap.

  
  

“You know, I was just painting you guys earlier. Before the landlord called.” I started talking to the cat.

  

“They said I was feeding you, the animals, or you were feeding me or something.”

  

“At that point in the call, I was just annoyed so I can’t fully remember what they said.”

  

“Do you know what they said when I explained about the visits? About you, the animals?”

  

“They said ‘Why don’t you just keep the windows closed and play it?’ That really got on my nerves.”

  

“It’s like treating the music, the sound that I make, something like disposable paint.”

  
  

I kept talking to the cat, letting out my rants and my thoughts. But it doesn’t seem to understand a single word that I say.

  
  

“The animals… You. You’re all here because you want to hear the piano, right?” I asked the cat.

  
  

It continued to stare at me with its black eyes. Eyes so black like the darkness that faded on the surface of the water.

  

I think I’ve seen those eyes before. Somewhere, from a distant past.

  
  

I was playing the sonata again.

  
  

The cat slowly raised its paw and moved in time with the sound. I picked up my sketchbook from the piano sheet stand and drew the imagery while the moonlight illuminated the keys.

  

I stood up after the sketch and suddenly felt something trickling down from my cheeks. It was tears. I was crying about something that I didn’t fully know. 

  

The cat came close to me and brought its nose to my cheek, as if it was giving me a kiss. I looked at it with tears still falling down from my eyes.

  
  

“Thanks to you and every single one of the animals that came, I can hold an exhibition.”

  

“Truly, thank you.”

  
  

The cat bowed as if thanking me as well, but it was actually just looking for a place to drop off from the piano. It eventually walked up towards and out the window and disappeared into the night.

  

That was the last time I saw them.
# Theater 8 (Epilogue): The Solo Exhibition

---

There were a series of paintings lined up and arranged on the stage. 

  
  

“This is a series of paintings depicting the strange animals that have come to visit my house. They sit in front of my piano after midnight and they dance a strange dance.” I said to the audience.

  
  

I was standing on stage, wearing a suit, delivering a short introduction to the paintings for the people who were in the exhibition.

  
  

“I hope you can appreciate them.” 

  
  

As the exhibition began, people started to walk towards the paintings. Meticulously investigating them. The room itself was decently large enough for a solo exhibition and it looked like it was recently renovated, as she said.

  

Though it was sparsely populated, I somewhat felt satisfied with the successful opening. I made connections with a lot of people.

  

People were saying that they liked the paintings, some even offered to buy them but I was unsure how to respond to them and told them that I’ll think about it. Eventually, after much deliberation, I agreed to sell them but kept the one with the cat.

  

While I was preparing some postcards and business cards to share with the guests, I was suddenly approached by someone.

  
  

“Can I have one?” a female voice asks me.

  
  

As I looked up from the papers on the table, I saw a familiar and nostalgic face. It was my ex-girlfriend whom I had broken up a long time ago.

  
  

“It’s been a long time. Thank you for everything today.” I said in reply.

  

“”I just wanted to give you a push because your paintings were good.”

  
  

I thought it was the highest compliment that I could ever receive.

  
  

“So how’s work treating you lately?” I asked.

  

“Oh nothing much. I’m keeping myself busy managing and planning exhibitions.”

  

“Ah, the usual.”

  

“Yep, I’m working on this one right now, it’s a bit hard but I’m having fun.”

  

“You-”

  
  

I stopped. I was about to say “You haven’t changed at all” but a bitter taste suddenly lingers through my throat. I noticed something shining from her hands. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it.

  
  

“People don’t seem to change, but they eventually do huh” I thought to myself.

  

“Hey, you were about to say something?” she interrupted.

  

“No, it’s just… it’s been a long time.” 

  

“...”

  
  

The atmosphere suddenly felt twice as heavy. Amidst the crowd of people talking about art in the room, there were two people silently conversing their thoughts.

  
  

“Anyway.” I broke the silence.

  

“Yeah…. So how’s the exhibition for you so far?” she asks.

  

“It’s.. a success. I got new connections, I got some people who wanted to commission me. 

  

There are people asking me to buy my paintings. Some wanted the paintings of the animals and some of the landscapes from a previous life titled ‘Dreaming of Scenes from a Former Life’.

  

None of which you said you liked.”

  

“What?” 

  

“You said you didn’t like my paintings right?”

  

“I- no? I didn’t say I didn’t like them, I just said they weren’t interesting enough.”

  

“Interesting enough? Isn’t that the same?” 

  

“No. What I meant is that they weren’t interesting enough to strike people’s hearts. I needed paintings that looked like pictures. Something that captures a scenery or imagery with a meaning behind it.

  

A picture, no matter how boring or uninteresting it may look, has a value to someone when a lot of thought was put into making it.

  

Those were the kind of works that I was willing to show to the people at an exhibition like this.”

  

“Again, you say such interesting words. Is it from someone else’s?”

  

“What? Whose words? They’re your words. You keep forgetting what you said.”

  
  

I’m at a loss for words. 

  
  

“You never change, do you?.” she asks with a smile.

“Enough about that.” 

  

As she said that, she waved her hand in front of her as if fanning the conversation away. I can see the ring on her finger glinting as the lights of the room shine on it.

  

“But I truly like those animals.” she says.

  

“Why?”

“The concept of all the paintings being unified makes it easier to convey their meaning to the ones looking at them. And…”

  

“And…?”

  

“And they look a little bit like you. Somehow.”

  

“Like me? Do they now?”

  

“Yeah. Well, I don’t know. They have a certain vibe to them.

  

Like the cat. You look especially a lot like the cat.”

  
  

She stops and then starts to shift her head up like a cat putting up its snout. She starts to imitate playing a piano like this.

  
  

“It’s like a strange dance don’t you think?” she remarked.

  
  

I was shocked as if I was hit on the head.

  

My memory of what we talked about after that left a warm feeling in me. We parted ways after saying goodbye and left the venue.

  

As soon as I got home, I sat down in front of the piano and started to play it.

  

I can’t remove the strange imagination she evoked in my head. The animals were “dancing”. 

  

Like the canary moving its arms over and over again as the music plays, ending with its wings spreading out. Or the movement of the chameleon’s tail in time with the rhythm…

  

I can’t believe it, but I can’t deny it either. They did happen after all.

  

“But didn’t they want to play the piano?” I asked myself.

  

I played Moonlight Sonata. I tried to imitate the animal’s movements with my own body, almost the same as that of the rabbit from before. I then tried to play the piano as if I was the cat. 

  

I stopped in the middle of the keys and looked at my reflection in the mirror. Sitting in front of the piano darkly and silently.

  

“A strange dance huh. I wonder…” I muttered to myself.

  

I continued to play the piece. Moving my hands as if I were dancing in tune to the music.

Extra Notes: 
[1] Most of this story was based on deduction on existing information. Only certain parts of this story had been wholly confirmed in writing from the artist through interviews and the information from the Live Tours. Other parts were deduced and followed the ideology of nbuna of “Connecting all the works within Yorushika’s discography.”
[2] You may take this with a grain of salt, but this has been widely accepted(at least within the Yorushika Fan Discord) as the part that fills in the gaps in-between the major stories.

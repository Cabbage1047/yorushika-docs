On the Seabed

00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:14,083
We are at the bottom of a deep sea

3
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:18,487
We are at the bottom of a deep sea

4
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:23,560
A desert of words extends from directly below

5
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:27,994
While waves of expression surfaced far above

6
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,448
We can’t breathe freely

7
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:33,227
We can’t even move our mouths

8
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,955
We are at the bottom of a deep sea

9
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:39,888
Whatever was available, was enough

10
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,675
The desire to express oneself has no bounds

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,682
We are at the bottom of a deep sea

12
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:45,406
At the bottom of an even deeper sea

13
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:48,851
Floating, with a body seemingly crushed by the water pressure

14
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:52,145
Floating, trying to reach for the moonlight on the water

15
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:55,491
We are whales
At the bottom of an even deeper sea

16
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:58,708
We are whales
Swallowing the krill of words

17
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:02,730
While drawing and swimming deep in the sea of imagination

18
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:04,963
Always

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,747

Before the seasons turned to summer,
I wrote about the fireworks in my heart

25

The night is about to fall,
and the day after tomorrow is all that I see

26
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,884
I’ll say it one more time

27
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,324
I’ll recall that one August day

28
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,199
They’re the only things I can never speak enough of

29
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,438
The two measures ring out from my guitar

30
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,974
This song is 380 characters long

31
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,729
I wrote rock and roll songs

32
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:13,663
And only sang of that summer

33
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:17,835
“Goodbye” alone is not enough

34
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:22,461
I want to sing of glowing red days to you

35
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:27,094
Just remembering will never be enough

36
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:34,991
I wait for a summer with swimming flowers,
and you turn into words

37
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:55,202
I wrote of the fireworks in that summer
so I wouldn’t forget

38
00:02:55,773 --> 00:03:03,210
The us in my memories are like ghosts you can’t see anytime but at night

39
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,637
There’s nothing good left

40
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:08,848
This world was difficult for me to understand

41
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:11,681
It’s just full of things you never taught me

42
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,187
We played piano in that hall

43
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:17,109
That cafe doesn’t exist anymore

44
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:19,358
I want to kill the two we talked so badly about

45
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:21,563
If you were here, you’d definitely laugh at that

46
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:24,919
How things are now still isn’t enough

47
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:30,168
I want us to be lost in a breeze obfuscated by flowers

48
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:34,637
The mere act of remembering is painful

49
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:39,221
I dream that summer will come

50
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:43,256
And with that, a hole opened up in my heart

51
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:05,104
Singing songs alone won’t be enough

52
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,359
I want to sing of glowing red days to you

53
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:14,026
I want to know what a beautiful night is like

54
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:18,159
I wait for a summer of fireworks

My heart became irritated; as I walked, it got hard to breathe

59

When I first ran away from my part-time job

60
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:21,656
I didn’t care anymore about music or life or anything

The night wind tickled my nose, and the pain in my heart wasn’t real–

Because these lyrics, too, are the worst

The first time I sold my heart

I’m the worst, I’m too arrogant; you’re as greedy as anyone else

There’s no point in dramatic songs or loves, it just makes you look like a fool

It’s the worst, it’s the worst; these words are just redundant

Your life is moonlight

103
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,714
I could never say it was commonplace

104

It’s the worst, it’s the worst; I can’t help being laughed at

105
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:42,136
These lyrics that sound nice but mean nothing are the worst

I can't even afford to buy flowers

117

Frankly, I'm tired of the part-time work that I do for a living

What would I do now

130
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,064
The value of one's life is in the way it ends

131
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,330
If that was the case, then I'd like to preserve the meaning of my birth

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:17,428
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night

I just, I just picture you

184
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,861

185

186
00:14:58,226 --> 00:15:02,951

The ultramarine town is reflected in the window

351

The early summer rain flows through the drainpipe

352
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,177
In a daze, I’m watching as

353
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:06,968
A single drop falls, falls

354
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:10,292
The shape of my heart is rectangular

355
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:13,083
It lives only in this sheet of paper

356
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:16,190
While you exist only in the supernate

357
00:31:16,215 --> 00:31:20,484
Floating on the surface of the lyrics that I wrote one after another

358
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,641
It’s all so pointless

359
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,091
It’s just stupid

360
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,807
I want to see something that’s not rational

361
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:31,682
Because I’m sure it would be unfortunate only to forget

362
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:34,025

Sew it up with words

366
00:31:41,488 --> 00:31:43,703
Wait for me in that town

367
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,347
The street lights dance to the sound of the rain

368
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:16,057
I pass twilight and turn at the corner,

369
00:32:16,332 --> 00:32:19,282
A one-person parade of footsteps

370
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:22,468
The clouds that wait for the summer are a misty blue

371
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:25,074
My life now is i^2

372
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,990
Subtracting you left me below zero

373
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:31,301
I can only see you in my memories

374
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:35,135
In the aftermath of the June rain

375
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:38,919
Scribbling down even your smiling face

376
00:32:38,944 --> 00:32:40,319
Digging deep into my heart

377
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:43,766
I knew that it was unconvincing

378
00:32:44,174 --> 00:32:48,968
Though it’s unfortunate only to forget even the strong scent of rain

379
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:51,923
I wish I could’ve seen your face

380
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:55,006

381
00:32:56,422 --> 00:32:59,238
Written about that summer

382
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,588
Everything’s so trivial

383
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:23,944
Getting involved with others is too much trouble

384
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:29,899
Even putting my thoughts into words is a pain

385
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,130
In the end, was it always only you?

I always knew it wasn’t rational

389

I’m always writing about the rainy town

390
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,054
And the strong scent of rain

391
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,779
Moving your heart

392
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:55,146

I want to feel this love song more, I want to feel it more

I want to feel the blue of the summer without you as well

418

A white curtain swayed

It softly swayed, it swayed to me, and touched upon our love

Even if you turn into words, those songs you left behind and

Poetry
In Visby

430
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:29,609
I was searching for the place closest to heaven

431
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,799
Somewhere along the way, I found myself walking through a seaside town

432
00:39:32,824 --> 00:39:34,399
I made my way through a back alley,

433
00:39:34,424 --> 00:39:36,159
and when I took a right,

434
00:39:36,184 --> 00:39:39,625
I began to hear the faint sound of ocean waves

435
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:42,543
I saw a cat mewling in the shadow of a flowerpot

436
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:45,274
It gave off the illusion that the summer was coming to an end

437
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,835
I turned my head towards the crying, entranced by it

438
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,718
The cat nuzzled against me with its flexible body

439
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:54,954
And then it disappeared into the summer shadows

440
00:39:57,352 --> 00:40:02,066
Without realizing it, a bicycle approached from behind me,
the owner glaring at me as he approached

441
00:40:02,091 --> 00:40:03,564
I surrendered the path to him

442
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:07,910
With that, I finally had a clear view of the road I had traversed

443
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:09,131
Far away,

444
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,747
At the church far beyond the hill I had climbed,

445
00:40:11,772 --> 00:40:15,288
I had prayed that morning

446
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:18,784
When I remembered that moment,

A small hole opened up

529
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:03,135
Right in the middle of my chest

530
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:07,135
A night-imitating twilight

531
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:11,691
Painted the town

532
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:16,606

But in the blue sky that buries my mind that wants to forget, I only see you

That’s why a hole opened up in my heart

536

My heartbeat pounded as if to fill it in

When I opened my mouth to talk to you

538
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:36,384
What came out was mostly excuses

539

That’s why a hole opened up in my heart

It’s like sleeping in a forest

544
00:50:12,511 --> 00:50:17,060
where a hole has gradually opened in the light coming through the leaves

545
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,734
Deep like the bottom of the sea

If you stay silent, you’ll never get the things you deserve

I want to write about my life, which I wanted to make into your life

702
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,693
my memories,

703
01:10:57,718 --> 01:10:59,752
the rainy café terrace,

704
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:01,978
the night-imitating twilight,

705
01:11:02,003 --> 01:11:03,527
Fujimidoori,

706
01:11:03,552 --> 01:11:07,434
my journey to find the closest place to heaven,

707
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:08,709
the melodies,

708
01:11:08,734 --> 01:11:10,484
the music,

709
01:11:10,509 --> 01:11:14,159
this moment in time that feels like I’m having a long dream,

710
01:11:14,184 --> 01:11:16,270
the scenery of that day,

711
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:19,959
all of it,

712
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:24,024
What I’m looking upon - it’s a revolving lantern

713
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:25,196

That’s Why I Gave Up On Music

714
01:11:25,221 --> 01:11:27,446
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

715
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:29,296
Under the blue sky, I waited for you

716
01:11:29,321 --> 01:11:32,638
On that breezy afternoon, my imagination escaped the confines of the day

717
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,788
Hey, where do I go from here?

718
01:11:34,813 --> 01:11:37,188
No one has told me how to proceed

719
01:11:37,213 --> 01:11:41,575
I looked into your eyes and without a word I walked away

720
01:11:56,087 --> 01:11:57,937
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

721
01:11:57,962 --> 01:11:59,770
Youth is so boring

722
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:03,374
I tried to give up piano, but I can’t break the habit of playing on my desk

723
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:05,666
Hey, what will I do in the future?

724
01:12:05,691 --> 01:12:08,795
It shouldn’t be music, right?

725
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:10,707
Don’t worry

726
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:19,006
Even if I drew a single line in my heart

727
01:12:19,031 --> 01:12:21,974
No matter what I did, it wouldn’t disappear, even now, so

728
01:12:21,999 --> 01:12:26,046
Hey, I still remember

729
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:27,388
I’m mistaken

730
01:12:27,413 --> 01:12:29,938
I don’t understand, I don’t care

731
01:12:29,963 --> 01:12:33,855
About all you humans or the truth or love or the world or pain or life

732
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,690
Wanting to know what’s right or wrong is just a self-preservation instinct

733
01:12:37,715 --> 01:12:40,886
It’s your fault that I thought that

734
01:12:55,707 --> 01:12:59,538
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand why I truly don’t want to get older

735
01:12:59,563 --> 01:13:03,088
Just thinking “Someday I’m going to die” makes my chest feel hollow

736
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:04,886
“What will I do in the future?”

737
01:13:04,911 --> 01:13:07,939
When I grew up I understood

738
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,290
That I’m not going to do anything at all

739
01:13:10,315 --> 01:13:20,407
How do I explain why I hate people who put on happy faces?

740
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:27,580
It’s an inferiority complex haunting my unsatisfied mind like a ghost

741
01:13:27,605 --> 01:13:28,715
I’m not mistaken

742
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,182
Hey, with all your differences, you all are human

743
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:35,282
When you don’t have love or salvation or kindness or a foundation, it feels bad

744
01:13:35,307 --> 01:13:39,155
Feeling pain at something like a love song is a self-preservation instinct

745
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,244
Do I really not care? It’s your fault

746
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,991
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

747
01:13:59,016 --> 01:14:00,758
Why just living is painful

748
01:14:00,783 --> 01:14:02,675
Why you can’t make a living from something like music

749
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,637
I don’t care if the lyrics or whatever are lazily done

750
01:14:07,716 --> 01:14:09,837
I don’t care about anything

751
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:13,837
I’m probably not mistaken

752
01:14:15,856 --> 01:14:17,837
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

753
01:14:19,473 --> 01:14:21,504
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

754
01:14:32,914 --> 01:14:35,284
I’m mistaken, I understand

755
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:36,886
I don’t care

756
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:40,431
About all you humans or the truth or love or salvation or kindness or life

757
01:14:40,472 --> 01:14:44,298
Not being able to give the right answer is a self-preservation instinct

758
01:14:44,323 --> 01:14:48,174
I don’t care, it’s your fault

759
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:06,114
Even I had faith in something once

760
01:15:06,139 --> 01:15:08,064
Now the feeling is nothing but garbage

761
01:15:08,089 --> 01:15:09,768
I wrote to you so many times

762
01:15:09,793 --> 01:15:12,856
I didn’t care about whether I’d be rich and famous

763
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:18,678
It’s true, it’s really true, that’s how it was back then

764
01:15:19,026 --> 01:15:21,029
That’s why I-

765
01:15:23,009 --> 01:15:27,873
That’s why I gave up on music

766
01:15:44,252 --> 01:15:45,951
Poetry
Reincarnation

767
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:48,085
After all this time, I still think about it.

768
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,757
Even in the end, I was selfish.

769
01:15:50,782 --> 01:15:54,733
Even in the end, I can only think of music.

770
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:59,275
Elma, the letters and poems that I've written while on this trip...

771
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,407
I wonder if they'll reach you properly.

772
01:16:02,752 --> 01:16:05,896
I wonder what you'll think when you see them.

773
01:16:06,652 --> 01:16:09,430
I wonder if you'll understand what I mean.

774
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,877
I don't think you would understand.

775
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:17,361
After all this time.

776
01:16:17,386 --> 01:16:19,650
After all this time, I still miss you.

777
01:16:27,497 --> 01:16:30,030
I need to get there as fast as I can.

778
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:23,336
I wanted to see that crying face one more time.

779
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:25,348
I have to go.

780
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:27,472
I have to get there as fast as I can.

781
01:16:30,055 --> 01:16:33,876
Even if I were to be reborn, I have to see you.

782
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:37,921
Even if I were to be reborn, I have to see you.

783
01:16:38,143 --> 01:16:42,353
Even if I were to be reborn, I have to see you.

784
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:44,664
Even if I were to be reborn.

785
01:16:48,012 --> 01:16:50,820
Even if I have to be reborn.

786
01:17:21,673 --> 01:17:23,941
The thing that I just saw...

787
01:17:23,966 --> 01:17:28,229
The sounds that I heard, they must be from the revolving lantern...

788
01:17:28,805 --> 01:17:33,740
The revolving lantern's waves as gentle as the moonlight...

789
01:17:34,273 --> 01:17:36,228
I closed my eyes.

790
01:17:36,253 --> 01:17:39,239
I see something at the end of the road.

791
01:17:39,264 --> 01:17:43,163
In front of the hill... Who's standing there?

792
01:17:43,188 --> 01:17:45,309
I can picture your face.

793
01:17:45,344 --> 01:17:48,465
I start to walk slowly.

794
01:17:49,148 --> 01:17:54,057
It smells deeply of summer.

795
01:17:56,779 --> 01:18:01,323
Behind my eyelids, I see the light.

796
01:18:02,147 --> 01:18:06,526
A light similar to the dawn that illuminates only at night.

797
01:18:06,551 --> 01:18:11,090
A soft, dazzling, pale light that unmistakably is;

798
01:18:11,115 --> 01:18:14,734
the moonlight.

799
01:19:09,323 --> 01:19:19,849
To Elma

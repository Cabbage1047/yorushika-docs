3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,082
A strange...

4
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,379
dance...
I guess...

5
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,254
I recall the image of a bird
spreading its wings.

6
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:31,049
The bird looks at its reflection
in a puddle.

7
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,428
Wet with water, its feathers
gleam faintly.

8
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,848
Perhaps it flew through trees
laden with morning dew.

9
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,267
Even before the sun had fully risen,

10
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,728
its rays shone upon the bird's wings,

11
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,105
making them glisten so beautifully.

12
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,609
The bird in the puddle shakes its body,

13
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,112
and I can clearly see every drop
that is shaken off.

14
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,241
That's right. It's so crystal clear.

15
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,370
Many such sights exist in my mind.

16
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,915
I could say that I paint pictures

17
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,461
to download what's in my head.

18
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,756
There's a strange reality
in the panoramas of my mind.

19
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:15,302
And the resulting pictures
are just landscapes, so to speak.

20
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,972
Up until now, they haven't sold so well.

21
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,186
It was sunny outside.

22
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,855
I grabbed an empty paint tube
from the desk

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,483
and threw it in the bin,
dust scattering.

24
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,153
Caught in the spring sunlight
streaming through the window,

25
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,782
the particles sparkled,
as they swirled and danced.

26
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,452
Despite the beautiful weather,
my mood is dark.

27
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,539
Over the past few weeks, I've struggled
to paint anything meaningful.

28
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,376
It's not that I can't.

29
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,961
I just don't have the motivation.

30
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,757
I find myself alternating between
my bed and the canvas.

31
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,217

00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,458
If you want a picture to sell,
it needs to tell a story.

359
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,127
Unless your picture

360
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,963
has something that says, 」Look at me,」

361
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,841
it will never touch other people's hearts.

362
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,969
As a child, I was better at art
than with people.

363
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,681
Come to think of it, I still want to draw
what I wanted to then.

364
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,810
I have a very clear picture
of a scene in my mind.

365
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,480
Whenever I want to draw,
that comes to mind first.

366
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:24,818
A road where sunlight shines
between the trees.

367
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,987
A shopping arcade at sunset.

368
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,738
A bench and a church.

369
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,032
A town in a foreign country.

370
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,910
Rain on a cafe terrace.

371
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,497
It's so clear, it's annoying.

372
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:42,085
I can even see clearly each leaf
in an unfamiliar landscape.

373
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,214
I output it onto the canvas
without making a single change to it.

374
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:51,887
My drawings are not interesting.

375
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,059
My drawings are not interesting.

376
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,939
(Sigh)

377
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,234
Another day has ended.

378
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,361
I light a cigarette

379
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,615
and place my hands on
the window sill as I exhale.

380
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,452
Then I feel something slimy
on my fingertips.

381
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,870
Yuck.

382
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,999
I see something light green.

383
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:25,003
(Frog croaking)

384
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,755
It's a frog.

385
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,592
I don't like these kinds of things.

386
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,639
Hey. Go away. Get out.

387
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:39,017
Don't make me say,
」Leap frog out of here.」

388
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,894
Hurry up. Get out.

389
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:46,691
I have a strange sense of
déjà vu as I shoo it away.

390
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,070
I feel as if I did
something similar before.

391
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,240
Oh well. Whatever.

392
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,135
Whoa!

393
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,096
(Frog croaking)

394
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,765
The thing came inside.

395
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,309
Give me a break, would you?

396
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,230
Hey, this isn't your home, you know.

397
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,731
Go on. Get out.

398
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,857
(Clicks tongue)

399
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,697
I finally realize why I feel this déjà vu.

400
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,534
It's that canary that showed up one day.

401
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,912
This thing has
that same strange impudence.

402
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,499
I give up and drop my arms,
striking the piano keys.

403
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,251
(Piano sound)

404
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,046
The frog twitches.

405
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:55,885
I tentatively raise my index finger
and press a key again.

406
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,304
It's a G note.

407
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,889
(Piano plays)

408
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,019
The frog slowly lifts its body.

409
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,105
I play the key again, and the frog moves.

410
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,734
I pull out the chair and sit down again.

411
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,446
Then I play the melody from 」Moonlight.」

412
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:25,123
♪～(Piano Sonata 」Moonlight」)

413
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:29,669
With its body still lifted,
it raises its arms.

414
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,463
On a whim,

415
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,049
I grab the sketchbook and pencil again.

416
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,927
I sketch the figure of the still frog
with its head held high

417
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,679
with my pen.

418
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,432
Though it's an ordinary frog,

419
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,061
it's almost as if
it has a mysterious allure to it.

420
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,522
I draw, and then I play the piano again.

421
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,317
I draw and play, play and draw.

422
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,487
It's figure is now in my sketchbook.

423
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,784
The frog's arms slowly wander in the air,

424
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,953
as if it is looking for something.

425
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,666
I can smell the night sea breeze.

426
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,461
The frog lifts its nose high

427
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,131
and flaps it little green arms.

428
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:20,804

a strange dance.

00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,970
Gauche is visited nightly

539
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,848
by an animal who asks him
to play his cello.」

540
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:26,974
Really?

541
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,268
」This is what that's like.

542
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,772
A serious guy like you
would never make that up,」

543
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,233
she adds with a laugh.

544
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,277
I murmur that it's no lie.

545
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,947
<i>Gauche the Cellist...</i>

546
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:45,034
Come to think of it,
I think I read it as a child.

547
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,537
It is similar. But it's also not.

548
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:51,415
The ones that visit me dance.

549
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,210
At night,
they come to my window and stare.

550
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,922
And they only react when I play the piano.

551
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:02,426
The frog raised and waved its arms,
and the canary spread its wings.

552
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,678
」Really?」

553
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,889
I thought she didn't believe me.

554
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,767
I guess that only makes sense.

555
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,520
Not long ago, a bat came to visit me.

556
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:13,729
(Bat cries)

557
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,315
It's not often you see a bat close-up.

558
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,942
So it was interesting.
(Bat cries)

559
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:18,067
(Bat cries)

560
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:18,317
(Bat cries)
It stood up straight on the window sill.

561
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,528
It stood up straight on the window sill.

562
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:21,988
We think of bats being upside down.

563
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:22,780
We think of bats being upside down.
(Bat cries)

564
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:22,905
(Bat cries)

565
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:23,948
(Bat cries)
But when it isn't upside down, it's more...

566
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,449
But when it isn't upside down, it's more...

567
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,410
I guess you'd call it handsome.

568
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:31,163
It gave me the impression
that it was a gentleman.

569
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,207
」Really?」

570
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,961
There's more. Yesterday,
a rabbit was outside my window.

571
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:37,920
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)

572
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,383
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)
I was suspicious, but when I played
the piano, it lifted its front legs

573
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:42,508
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)

574
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:46,512
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)
and stretched out its arms,
swinging them back and forth.

575
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:46,554
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)

576
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,515
」That's cute.」

577
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,478
That was the fourth animal.
These aren't coincidences.

578
00:46:55,646 --> 00:47:00,484
It made me wonder what it exactly was

579
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:04,113
these animals who came at night
were here to do.

580
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,034
When they moved their bodies
to the rhythm of the piano,

581
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,746
it was like they were trying to
express something.

582
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,541
That's it. This was a dance.

583
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,170
The spirit of a long-dead
regret-filled musician

584
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,923
is possessing the animals
and making them dance!

585
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,218
Might that be it?

586
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:34,560
」Well, even if I do believe your story,
were those really dances?

587
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,313
Maybe you just imagined they were dancing?」

588
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,106
You're wrong.

589
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,902
You won't understand unless you see.

590
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,739
」Really? Then maybe
I'll come over to watch sometime.」

591
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,868
I was a little shocked
and at a loss for words.

592
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:56,040
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
They don't come that often.

593
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,209
They hardly ever visit me.

594
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,504
」I'm just kidding,」 she said.

595
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:05,299
I realized she must believe
I'm lying even more now.

596
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,802
Anyway, that's what's been up.

597
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,137
I have no ideas, so I sketch them

598
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,931
to distract myself.

599
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:15,226
」I like it. The pictures
would go well with the story.

600
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,269
You should do children's books.」

601
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,231
You think? All I can do is draw.

602
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,191
」Drawings are all you need.」

603
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,110
Who would enjoy that?

604
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,070
」What? Nowadays, there are

605
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:29,281
many books of just pictures to imagine to.

606
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:34,370
What's more, a picture can say
just as much as words can.」

607
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,915
I'm impressed by what she says.

608
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,167
Who said that?

609
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,836
」You did.

610
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:45,005
Have you forgotten what you once told me?

611
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:49,343
You sure have changed,」
she says, poking fun at me.

612
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,054
I couldn't respond.

613
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,099
She was right.

614
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:59,353
A picture can say just as much as words.

615
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,357
All creations are nothing more
than words in a different form.

616
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,819
I was once so passionate
that I spoke words like that.

617
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:12,032
I had a passion that expresses more
than just skill and practice can.

618
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,702
Did I really say that?

619
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,038
I felt a little embarrassed
when saying that.

620
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:22,626
Then I hated myself
for feeling embarrassed.

621
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,130
I thought to myself, 」I think I understand

622
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,466
why she lost interest in me.」

623
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,926
I change the subject.

624
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,346
About that story, what happens at the end?

625
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,640
」Huh? You mean Gauche?」

626
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:37,975
Yeah.

627
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:42,146
She took a meaningful tone and said,

628
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,025
」He pondered about
the animals who visited,

629
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,445
wishing that he had treated them better.」

630
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,779
Really?

631
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,532
」Maybe you should be more careful.

632
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,285
Like they say, hindsight is 20/20.」

633
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:01,540
I realized she was being ironic.

634
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:06,337
Are you referring to us who broke up
because things didn't work out?

635
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:11,133
Well, anyway, I'll be careful.

636
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,386
I heard her laughing over the phone.

637
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,312
In the now silent room,
I pondered the words she said

638
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,357
just before hanging up the phone.

639
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,692
」Why not try drawing something

640
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,820
based on those animals?」

641
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,957
As I look at the sketches before me,

642
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:47,878

01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:18,483
My body shivers.

887
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,737
Then, I fly

888
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,364
toward the sun.

889
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:29,410
Eventually, I run out of energy and fall.

890
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,581
When I woke up, I remembered it clearly.

891
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,334
When I drew it on paper,

892
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,545
I got a mysteriously good feeling.

893
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:45,384
Now that I think about it,
that was the first picture I drew.

894
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,846
(Sound of a toy piano)

895
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:55,061
I doubt I am any different than then.

896
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:58,272
Or rather, I have not changed.

897
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,400
I am better at using a brush and pen,

898
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,319
but that is all.

899
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:07,698
Only my sketching is better.
Only my perspective is more accurate.

900
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:10,785
Only my lines are more beautiful.

901
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:16,666
What is in my head, what is before me,

902
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,961
I am merely copying what I see there.

903
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,380
When asked if that's what I want to draw,

904
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,382
I tilt my head.

905
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,344
I am empty.

906
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:32,056
I sometimes become afraid.

907
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:36,060
Is what I am doing actually

908
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:41,190
not much different than
what a camera does?

909
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:49,866
(Sound of a toy piano)

910
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:55,538
When I think too much about things
like that, I play this song.

911
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:59,709
Piano sonata 14, the Moonlight Sonata.

912
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,919
I love this song.

913
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,714
I was taught it when I was a child.

914
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:09,802
It clearly sounds like a depressing song,
but how can I put this...

915
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,348
Nobody has ever agreed with me on this,

916
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:17,685
but when I play this, I become incredibly

917
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,689
nostalgic.

918
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:30,781
My eyes meet the yellow crescent moons.

919
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,577
I don't care and keep playing the keys.

920
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,622
Every time the scratchy sound is played,

921
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:42,376
I see the owl fluffing its wings
in discomfort.

as a motif for my drawings,

Huh? No, seriously.
I was visited by a deer. A stag.

01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:58,500
Yeah, I get it. It sounds unbelievable.

1005
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:02,128
Yes, the first one is of a human...

1006
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:05,632
I mean, humans are animals too,
so I just had to draw it.

1007
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,218
The motif?

1008
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:10,846

of mysterious animals
that visted my home.

1317
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:25,862
After midnight,
they would sit near my piano

1318
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:28,072
and dance strange dances.

1319
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:31,868
There was a mysterious charm to them.

1320
02:01:32,243 --> 02:01:36,372
They inspired me to create
this series of ten paintings.

1321
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:39,793
I certainly hope that you enjoy them.

1322
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:47,175
It was time for my exhibition.

1323
02:01:47,383 --> 02:01:49,928
I have a small sheet of paper in my hands.

1324
02:01:50,094 --> 02:01:54,015
It's a small postcard-size sheet
outlining the solo exhibition.

1325
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:57,435
There were a few people
inside the small exhibition space

1326
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,729
in a renovated room of a building.

1327
02:01:59,854 --> 02:02:03,566
Still, I feel
a strange sense of satisfaction.

1328
02:02:05,235 --> 02:02:06,528
Hello.

1329
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:09,322
Well, if it isn't my landlord.

1330
02:02:09,447 --> 02:02:12,867
I see you've come. Thank you.

1331
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:15,703
Please, enjoy.

1332
02:02:16,496 --> 02:02:18,373
(Woman) May I have one?

1333
02:02:18,873 --> 02:02:20,750
I hear a voice.

1334
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:24,128
I see a once familiar face.

1335
02:02:24,629 --> 02:02:29,092
She's the girlfriend
I broke up with a while back.

1336
02:02:30,677 --> 02:02:36,474
Nice to see you. I appreciate
all your help with this.

1337
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:37,809
(Ex-girlfriend) No problem.

1338
02:02:37,934 --> 02:02:41,771
The pictures are good.
I just wanted to lend you a hand.

1339
02:02:42,814 --> 02:02:45,859
You seem pretty busy lately.

1340
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:47,026
(Ex-girlfriend) Yes.

1341
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:51,281
Since I plan exhibitions while working,
I don't have much time.

1342
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:55,034
But I enjoy it. It's what I want to do.

1343
02:02:55,326 --> 02:02:59,789
I stop myself before saying,
」You haven't changed.」

1344
02:03:00,498 --> 02:03:04,669
People seem as if they haven't changed,
but everyone changes.

1345
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:07,630
Time doesn't pass only for me.

1346
02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:13,595
She looks at the paper in her left
hand,while my eyes are glued

1347
02:03:13,928 --> 02:03:16,347
to the ring on her ring finger.

1348
02:03:17,682 --> 02:03:22,145
Well, anyway... Enjoy.

1349
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:27,150
(Ex-girlfriend) Yes. I'm hoping
this will be a good exhibition for you.

1350
02:03:29,903 --> 02:03:33,114
There's nothing special
I can say about the exhibition.

1351
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:37,577
It lasted for a few weeks
and ended without incident.

1352
02:03:37,702 --> 02:03:42,123
One big development was that offers
were made on some of the paintings.

1353
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:48,254
After much deliberation,
I kept the cat picture, and sold the rest.

1354
02:03:52,216 --> 02:03:53,635
(Ex-girlfriend) Nice work.

1355
02:03:53,968 --> 02:03:55,803
Oh, thank you.

1356
02:03:55,929 --> 02:03:58,431
(Ex-girlfriend) How was the exhibition?

1357
02:03:58,681 --> 02:03:59,849
It was great.

1358
02:03:59,974 --> 02:04:03,186
It's good to hear people's
reactions in person.

1359
02:04:03,311 --> 02:04:05,438
And I think I made some connections.

1360
02:04:05,563 --> 02:04:08,775
But best of all,
I got a job offer to paint.

1361
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:11,402
After seeing this, they wanted to work with me.

1362
02:04:11,527 --> 02:04:12,445
(Ex-girlfriend) Really?

1363
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:14,656
And I sold several paintings.

1364
02:04:14,781 --> 02:04:17,200
Not just of the dancing animals,

1365
02:04:17,325 --> 02:04:19,661
but some of my old paintings too.

1366
02:04:19,786 --> 02:04:21,329
(Ex-girlfriend) That's fantastic!

1367
02:04:21,454 --> 02:04:23,289
I told you about them before.

1368
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:26,918
They're based on dreams of scenes
from a previous life.

1369
02:04:27,043 --> 02:04:29,837
Remember? You said you didn't like them.

1370
02:04:29,963 --> 02:04:31,214
(Ex-girlfriend) I remember those.

1371
02:04:31,339 --> 02:04:34,926
But that's not what I meant
when I said that.

1372
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:38,388
I never said that I didn't like them.

1373
02:04:39,013 --> 02:04:39,931
Huh?

1374
02:04:40,056 --> 02:04:42,308
(Ex-girlfriend)
I just said they were dull.

1375
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:45,728
I said, for a picture to be
accessible to people,

1376
02:04:45,853 --> 02:04:49,190
it's better if there's something
interesting about it.

1377
02:04:49,315 --> 02:04:54,070
Being dull doesn't affect
the quality of the painting.

1378
02:04:54,195 --> 02:04:56,614
Even if the setting's commonplace,

1379
02:04:56,739 --> 02:05:00,284
the painting will still have its own
unique value.

1380
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:04,163
Even paintings
nobody buys are great paintings.

1381
02:05:07,583 --> 02:05:11,546
Come to think of it, she's probably right.

1382
02:05:12,839 --> 02:05:15,466
Painting is my livelihood,

1383
02:05:15,758 --> 02:05:19,679
so she was just giving me some
helpful advice.

1384
02:05:19,929 --> 02:05:23,182
She wasn't judging me.

1385
02:05:24,225 --> 02:05:27,020
What was it that possessed me?

1386
02:05:28,646 --> 02:05:33,067
That's a great thought.
Who said it? It really encouraged me.

1387
02:05:33,192 --> 02:05:35,028
(Ex-girlfriend) You said it.

1388
02:05:35,778 --> 02:05:38,698
Have you forgotten what you once said?

1389
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:42,493
You haven't changed a bit.

1390
02:05:45,413 --> 02:05:47,665
I'm at a loss for words.

1391
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:51,461
Bathed in the evening light
streaming in through the window,

1392
02:05:51,586 --> 02:05:54,255
she laughs mischievously.

1393
02:05:55,214 --> 02:05:59,260
The ring on her ring finger sparkles.

1394
02:06:03,556 --> 02:06:05,683
(Ex-girlfriend)
We'll say bye here. Thank you.

1395
02:06:05,808 --> 02:06:08,978
Okay. I've got to get back
to clean up anyway.

1396
02:06:09,103 --> 02:06:10,104
(Ex-girlfriend)
Hang in there.

1397
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:12,648
I'll send you the final paperwork later.

1398
02:06:12,774 --> 02:06:13,816
Okay.

1399
02:06:13,941 --> 02:06:16,778
(Ex-girlfriend)
So, are you glad you did it?

1400
02:06:19,781 --> 02:06:21,324
It really feels like

1401
02:06:21,741 --> 02:06:25,078
these are my first
interesting paintings in a while.

1402
02:06:25,453 --> 02:06:29,791
I've gotten work too.
My future seems bright.

1403
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:35,004
It's all thanks to those animals.

1404
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:39,300
(Ex-girlfriend) You're so deadpan,
I can't tell when you're kidding.

1405
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:41,594
Oh, sorry.

1406
02:06:41,719 --> 02:06:44,055
(Ex-girlfriend) I think it's
a great concept though.

1407
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:46,641
Animals are cute and accessible.

1408
02:06:46,766 --> 02:06:50,436
The paintings had a coherent theme
and were easy on the eyes.

1409
02:06:50,561 --> 02:06:53,731
And it was quite amusing, too.

1410
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:54,857
What was?

1411
02:06:54,982 --> 02:06:58,778
(Ex-girlfriend) Those animals
kind of resemble you.

1412
02:06:58,903 --> 02:07:01,948
Really?
Do I look that much like an animal?

1413
02:07:02,073 --> 02:07:07,703
How can I phrase it? Your expressions,
your mannerisms. Your aura.

1414
02:07:08,329 --> 02:07:10,748
Like that cat.

1415
02:07:10,873 --> 02:07:13,835
It looks just like you
when you play the piano.

1416
02:07:14,502 --> 02:07:19,841
Eyes closed, looking upward
with your nose poking into the air.

1417
02:07:23,386 --> 02:07:24,887
The piano?

1418
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:28,349
(Ex-girlfriend) Yes. The piano.

1419
02:07:49,370 --> 02:07:51,873
Dancing animals...

1420
02:07:55,293 --> 02:07:58,254
This is a series of paintings

1421
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:03,092
of mysterious animals
that visted my home.

1422
02:08:04,302 --> 02:08:09,599
After midnight,
they would sit near my piano

1423
02:08:10,099 --> 02:08:13,186
and dance a strange dance.

1424
02:08:16,898 --> 02:08:19,066
A strange dance...

1425
02:08:25,781 --> 02:08:28,201
A strange dance...

1426
02:08:36,959 --> 02:08:40,796
A strange dance...

1427
02:08:43,674 --> 02:08:47,595
It looks just like you
when you play the piano...

1428
02:08:57,563 --> 02:08:59,732
(Piano plays)

1429
02:09:08,032 --> 02:09:11,702
No, maybe it's the other way around.

1430
02:09:12,703 --> 02:09:14,956
Was I mistaken?

1431
02:09:16,082 --> 02:09:19,669
They weren't dancing.

1432
02:09:20,628 --> 02:09:26,008
Maybe they wanted to play the piano...

1433
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:37,853
♪～(Piano Sonata 」Moonlight」)

1434
02:09:37,979 --> 02:09:40,314
I stand before the piano.

1435
02:09:40,815 --> 02:09:43,818
Moonlight illuminates the piano keys.

1436
02:09:44,193 --> 02:09:48,197
As I look at myself in the mirror
out of the side of my eye,

1437
02:09:48,364 --> 02:09:51,450
I slowly lower my arms to play.

1438
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:55,329
That melody I have played many times,

1439
02:09:55,788 --> 02:10:00,001
Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14.

1440
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:03,838
I see myself in the mirror.

1441
02:10:04,505 --> 02:10:08,050
My body moves as I play the piano keys.

1442
02:10:08,426 --> 02:10:14,807
And it looks as if I'm dancing
a strange dance.

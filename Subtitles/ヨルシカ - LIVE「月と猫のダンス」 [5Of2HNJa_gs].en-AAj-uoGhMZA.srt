3

A strange...

4
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,310
dance...
I guess...

5
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,219
I recall the image of a bird
spreading its wings.

6
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,856
The bird looks at its reflection
in a puddle.

7
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,359
Wet with water, its feathers
gleam faintly.

8
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,696
Perhaps it flew through trees
laden with morning dew.

9
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,232
Even before the sun had fully risen,

10
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,601
its rays shone upon the bird's wings,

11
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,104
making them glisten so beautifully.

12
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,507
The bird in the puddle shakes its body,

13
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,111
and I can clearly see every drop
that is shaken off.

14
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,215
That's right. It's so crystal clear.

15
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,319
Many such sights exist in my mind.

16
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,755
I could say that I paint pictures

17
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,392
to download what's in my head.

18
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,629
There's a strange reality
in the panoramas of my mind.

19
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,267
And the resulting pictures
are just landscapes, so to speak.

20
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,804
Up until now, they haven't sold so well.

21
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,176
It was sunny outside.

22
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,712
I grabbed an empty paint tube
from the desk

23
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,414
and threw it in the bin,
dust scattering.

24
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,152
Caught in the spring sunlight
streaming through the window,

25
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,655
the particles sparkled,
as they swirled and danced.

26
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,392
Despite the beautiful weather,
my mood is dark.

27
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,463
Over the past few weeks, I've struggled
to paint anything meaningful.

28
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,332
It's not that I can't.

29
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,801
I just don't have the motivation.

30
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,639
I find myself alternating between
my bed and the canvas.

31
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,207

00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,348
If you want a picture to sell,
it needs to tell a story.

359
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,083
Unless your picture

360
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,953
has something that says, 」Look at me,」

361
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,656
it will never touch other people's hearts.

362
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,959
As a child, I was better at art
than with people.

363
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,529
Come to think of it, I still want to draw
what I wanted to then.

364
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,633
I have a very clear picture
of a scene in my mind.

365
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,370
Whenever I want to draw,
that comes to mind first.

366
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:23,641
A road where sunlight shines
between the trees.

367
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,977
A shopping arcade at sunset.

368
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,578
A bench and a church.

369
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,014
A town in a foreign country.

370
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,717
Rain on a cafe terrace.

371
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,387
It's so clear, it's annoying.

372
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:41,059
I can even see clearly each leaf
in an unfamiliar landscape.

373
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,163
I output it onto the canvas
without making a single change to it.

374
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,702
My drawings are not interesting.

375
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:57,041
My drawings are not interesting.

376
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,746
(Sigh)

377
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,183
Another day has ended.

378
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,285
I light a cigarette

379
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,488
and place my hands on
the window sill as I exhale.

380
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:14,359
Then I feel something slimy
on my fingertips.

381
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,693
Yuck.

382
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,998
I see something light green.

383
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:24,002
(Frog croaking)

384
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,603
It's a frog.

385
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,474
I don't like these kinds of things.

386
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:34,512
Hey. Go away. Get out.

387
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,016
Don't make me say,
」Leap frog out of here.」

388
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,717
Hurry up. Get out.

389
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:45,556
I have a strange sense of
déjà vu as I shoo it away.

390
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:49,060
I feel as if I did
something similar before.

391
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,196
Oh well. Whatever.

392
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,117
Whoa!

393
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,086
(Frog croaking)

394
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,622
The thing came inside.

395
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,258
Give me a break, would you?

396
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:24,195
Hey, this isn't your home, you know.

397
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,596
Go on. Get out.

398
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,697
(Clicks tongue)

399
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,570
I finally realize why I feel this déjà vu.

400
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,441
It's that canary that showed up one day.

401
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,744
This thing has
that same strange impudence.

402
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,414
I give up and drop my arms,
striking the piano keys.

403
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,216
(Piano sound)

404
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,853
The frog twitches.

405
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:54,725
I tentatively raise my index finger
and press a key again.

406
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,260
It's a G note.

407
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,729
(Piano plays)

408
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,834
The frog slowly lifts its body.

409
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,104
I play the key again, and the frog moves.

410
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,607
I pull out the chair and sit down again.

411
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:13,377
Then I play the melody from 」Moonlight.」

412
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:24,122
♪～(Piano Sonata 」Moonlight」)

413
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:28,559
With its body still lifted,
it raises its arms.

414
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,394
On a whim,

415
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,864
I grab the sketchbook and pencil again.

416
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,767
I sketch the figure of the still frog
with its head held high

417
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,569
with my pen.

418
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,372
Though it's an ordinary frog,

419
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,876
it's almost as if
it has a mysterious allure to it.

420
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,446
I draw, and then I play the piano again.

421
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,282
I draw and play, play and draw.

422
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,418
It's figure is now in my sketchbook.

423
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,657
The frog's arms slowly wander in the air,

424
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,793
as if it is looking for something.

425
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,564
I can smell the night sea breeze.

426
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,401
The frog lifts its nose high

427
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,938
and flaps it little green arms.

428
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:19,677

a strange dance.

00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,919
Gauche is visited nightly

539
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,822
by an animal who asks him
to play his cello.」

540
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:25,923
Really?

541
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,158
」This is what that's like.

542
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,762
A serious guy like you
would never make that up,」

543
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,131
she adds with a laugh.

544
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:37,167
I murmur that it's no lie.

545
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,903
<i>Gauche the Cellist...</i>

546
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:43,974
Come to think of it,
I think I read it as a child.

547
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,377
It is similar. But it's also not.

548
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,280
The ones that visit me dance.

549
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,117
At night,
they come to my window and stare.

550
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:56,887
And they only react when I play the piano.

551
00:45:56,987 --> 00:46:01,291
The frog raised and waved its arms,
and the canary spread its wings.

552
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,493
」Really?」

553
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,863
I thought she didn't believe me.

554
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,766
I guess that only makes sense.

555
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,368
Not long ago, a bat came to visit me.

556
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,536
(Bat cries)

557
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,205
It's not often you see a bat close-up.

558
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,907
So it was interesting.
(Bat cries)

559
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,007
(Bat cries)

560
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:17,207
(Bat cries)
It stood up straight on the window sill.

561
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,376
It stood up straight on the window sill.

562
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:20,944
We think of bats being upside down.

563
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,779
We think of bats being upside down.
(Bat cries)

564
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:21,879
(Bat cries)

565
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:22,913
(Bat cries)
But when it isn't upside down, it's more...

566
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,314
But when it isn't upside down, it's more...

567
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,283
I guess you'd call it handsome.

568
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:30,087
It gave me the impression
that it was a gentleman.

569
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:32,122
」Really?」

570
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,926
There's more. Yesterday,
a rabbit was outside my window.

571
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:36,894
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)

572
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:41,265
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)
I was suspicious, but when I played
the piano, it lifted its front legs

573
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:41,365
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)

574
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:45,369
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)
and stretched out its arms,
swinging them back and forth.

575
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:45,402
(Sound of a rabbit hopping)

576
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,372
」That's cute.」

577
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:53,343
That was the fourth animal.
These aren't coincidences.

578
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:59,349
It made me wonder what it exactly was

579
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,053
these animals who came at night
were here to do.

580
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,990
When they moved their bodies
to the rhythm of the piano,

581
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,561
it was like they were trying to
express something.

582
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,398
That's it. This was a dance.

583
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,101
The spirit of a long-dead
regret-filled musician

584
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,905
is possessing the animals
and making them dance!

585
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,142
Might that be it?

586
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:33,417
」Well, even if I do believe your story,
were those really dances?

587
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,220
Maybe you just imagined they were dancing?」

588
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,055
You're wrong.

589
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,892
You won't understand unless you see.

590
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,562
」Really? Then maybe
I'll come over to watch sometime.」

591
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:49,867
I was a little shocked
and at a loss for words.

592
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:55,005
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
They don't come that often.

593
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,140
They hardly ever visit me.

594
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,377
」I'm just kidding,」 she said.

595
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:04,214
I realized she must believe
I'm lying even more now.

596
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,617
Anyway, that's what's been up.

597
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,086
I have no ideas, so I sketch them

598
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,921
to distract myself.

599
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,157
」I like it. The pictures
would go well with the story.

600
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,193
You should do children's books.」

601
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,162
You think? All I can do is draw.

602
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,131
」Drawings are all you need.」

603
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,066
Who would enjoy that?

604
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,035
」What? Nowadays, there are

605
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:28,205
many books of just pictures to imagine to.

606
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:33,277
What's more, a picture can say
just as much as words can.」

607
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,914
I'm impressed by what she says.

608
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,116
Who said that?

609
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,651
」You did.

610
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,987
Have you forgotten what you once told me?

611
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:48,258
You sure have changed,」
she says, poking fun at me.

612
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,028
I couldn't respond.

613
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,064
She was right.

614
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:58,268
A picture can say just as much as words.

615
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:02,272
All creations are nothing more
than words in a different form.

616
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,642
I was once so passionate
that I spoke words like that.

617
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:11,014
I had a passion that expresses more
than just skill and practice can.

618
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,550
Did I really say that?

619
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,020
I felt a little embarrassed
when saying that.

620
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,491
Then I hated myself
for feeling embarrassed.

621
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:25,095
I thought to myself, 」I think I understand

622
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,364
why she lost interest in me.」

623
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,733
I change the subject.

624
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,270
About that story, what happens at the end?

625
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,505
」Huh? You mean Gauche?」

626
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:36,974
Yeah.

627
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:41,111
She took a meaningful tone and said,

628
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:45,015
」He pondered about
the animals who visited,

629
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,352
wishing that he had treated them better.」

630
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,619
Really?

631
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,422
」Maybe you should be more careful.

632
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:55,225
Like they say, hindsight is 20/20.」

633
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,430
I realized she was being ironic.

634
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:05,268
Are you referring to us who broke up
because things didn't work out?

635
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:10,107
Well, anyway, I'll be careful.

636
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:13,310
I heard her laughing over the phone.

637
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,252
In the now silent room,
I pondered the words she said

638
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,288
just before hanging up the phone.

639
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,557
」Why not try drawing something

640
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:30,660
based on those animals?」

641
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,772
As I look at the sketches before me,

642
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:46,710

01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,346
toward the sun.

887
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:28,384
Eventually, I run out of energy and fall.

888
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,521
When I woke up, I remembered it clearly.

889
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,324
When I drew it on paper,

890
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:38,494
I got a mysteriously good feeling.

891
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:44,366
Now that I think about it,
that was the first picture I drew.

892
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,736
(Sound of a toy piano)

893
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:53,909
I doubt I am any different than then.

894
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:57,079
Or rather, I have not changed.

895
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:00,382
I am better at using a brush and pen,

896
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,318
but that is all.

897
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:06,622
Only my sketching is better.
Only my perspective is more accurate.

898
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,692
Only my lines are more beautiful.

899
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:15,597
What is in my head, what is before me,

900
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:18,834
I am merely copying what I see there.

901
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,370
When asked if that's what I want to draw,

902
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,372
I tilt my head.

903
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,343
I am empty.

904
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,913
I sometimes become afraid.

905
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,917
Is what I am doing actually

906
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:40,022
not much different than
what a camera does?

907
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:48,764
(Sound of a toy piano)

908
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:54,503
When I think too much about things
like that, I play this song.

909
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:58,640
Piano sonata 14, the Moonlight Sonata.

910
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,809
I love this song.

911
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:03,645
I was taught it when I was a child.

912
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:08,717
It clearly sounds like a depressing song,
but how can I put this...

913
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:13,155
Nobody has ever agreed with me on this,

914
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,625
but when I play this, I become incredibly

915
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,629
nostalgic.

916
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,705
My eyes meet the yellow crescent moons.

917
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:33,542
I don't care and keep playing the keys.

918
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:36,578
Every time the scratchy sound is played,

919
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:41,183
I see the owl fluffing its wings
in discomfort.

like you told me before.

as a motif for my drawings,

it was unbelievably easy to draw them.

Huh? No, seriously.
I was visited by a deer. A stag.

Yeah, I get it. It sounds unbelievable.

1003
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:00,968
Yes, the first one is of a human...

1004
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:04,572
I mean, humans are animals too,
so I just had to draw it.

1005
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:07,041
The motif?

1006
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,744

This is a series of pictures

of mysterious animals
that visted my home.

1316
02:01:21,007 --> 02:01:24,744
After midnight,
they would sit near my piano

1317
02:01:24,844 --> 02:01:26,912
and dance strange dances.

1318
02:01:27,013 --> 02:01:30,750
There was a mysterious charm to them.

1319
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:35,354
They inspired me to create
this series of ten paintings.

1320
02:01:35,454 --> 02:01:38,691
I certainly hope that you enjoy them.

1321
02:01:42,762 --> 02:01:45,998
It was time for my exhibition.

1322
02:01:46,365 --> 02:01:48,801
I have a small sheet of paper in my hands.

1323
02:01:48,934 --> 02:01:52,872
It's a small postcard-size sheet
outlining the solo exhibition.

1324
02:01:52,972 --> 02:01:56,409
There were a few people
inside the small exhibition space

1325
02:01:56,509 --> 02:01:58,644
in a renovated room of a building.

1326
02:01:58,744 --> 02:02:02,515
Still, I feel
a strange sense of satisfaction.

1327
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:05,484
Hello.

1328
02:02:05,584 --> 02:02:08,321
Well, if it isn't my landlord.

1329
02:02:08,421 --> 02:02:11,757
I see you've come. Thank you.

1330
02:02:11,857 --> 02:02:14,627
Please, enjoy.

1331
02:02:15,461 --> 02:02:17,363
(Woman) May I have one?

1332
02:02:17,763 --> 02:02:19,665
I hear a voice.

1333
02:02:20,566 --> 02:02:22,968
I see a once familiar face.

1334
02:02:23,569 --> 02:02:27,940
She's the girlfriend
I broke up with a while back.

1335
02:02:29,608 --> 02:02:35,448
Nice to see you. I appreciate
all your help with this.

1336
02:02:35,548 --> 02:02:36,716
(Ex-girlfriend) No problem.

1337
02:02:36,816 --> 02:02:40,686
The pictures are good.
I just wanted to lend you a hand.

1338
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:44,757
You seem pretty busy lately.

1339
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:45,891
(Ex-girlfriend) Yes.

1340
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:50,096
Since I plan exhibitions while working,
I don't have much time.

1341
02:02:50,396 --> 02:02:53,899
But I enjoy it. It's what I want to do.

1342
02:02:54,133 --> 02:02:58,704
I stop myself before saying,
」You haven't changed.」

1343
02:02:59,472 --> 02:03:03,609
People seem as if they haven't changed,
but everyone changes.

1344
02:03:03,709 --> 02:03:06,579
Time doesn't pass only for me.

1345
02:03:06,946 --> 02:03:12,551
She looks at the paper in her left
hand,while my eyes are glued

1346
02:03:12,818 --> 02:03:15,154
to the ring on her ring finger.

1347
02:03:16,622 --> 02:03:20,993
Well, anyway... Enjoy.

1348
02:03:21,093 --> 02:03:25,998
(Ex-girlfriend) Yes. I'm hoping
this will be a good exhibition for you.

1349
02:03:28,801 --> 02:03:31,971
There's nothing special
I can say about the exhibition.

1350
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:36,542
It lasted for a few weeks
and ended without incident.

1351
02:03:36,642 --> 02:03:40,980
One big development was that offers
were made on some of the paintings.

1352
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:47,086
After much deliberation,
I kept the cat picture, and sold the rest.

1353
02:03:51,056 --> 02:03:52,591
(Ex-girlfriend) Nice work.

1354
02:03:52,858 --> 02:03:54,727
Oh, thank you.

1355
02:03:54,827 --> 02:03:57,430
(Ex-girlfriend) How was the exhibition?

1356
02:03:57,630 --> 02:03:58,764
It was great.

1357
02:03:58,864 --> 02:04:02,034
It's good to hear people's
reactions in person.

1358
02:04:02,134 --> 02:04:04,437
And I think I made some connections.

1359
02:04:04,537 --> 02:04:07,706
But best of all,
I got a job offer to paint.

1360
02:04:07,807 --> 02:04:10,209
After seeing this, they wanted to work with me.

1361
02:04:10,509 --> 02:04:11,444
(Ex-girlfriend) Really?

1362
02:04:11,544 --> 02:04:13,612
And I sold several paintings.

1363
02:04:13,712 --> 02:04:16,048
Not just of the dancing animals,

1364
02:04:16,148 --> 02:04:18,617
but some of my old paintings too.

1365
02:04:18,717 --> 02:04:20,152
(Ex-girlfriend) That's fantastic!

1366
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:22,121
I told you about them before.

1367
02:04:22,221 --> 02:04:25,825
They're based on dreams of scenes
from a previous life.

1368
02:04:25,925 --> 02:04:28,761
Remember? You said you didn't like them.

1369
02:04:28,861 --> 02:04:30,062
(Ex-girlfriend) I remember those.

1370
02:04:30,162 --> 02:04:33,833
But that's not what I meant
when I said that.

1371
02:04:33,933 --> 02:04:37,203
I never said that I didn't like them.

1372
02:04:37,903 --> 02:04:38,838
Huh?

1373
02:04:38,938 --> 02:04:41,140
(Ex-girlfriend)
I just said they were dull.

1374
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:44,677
I said, for a picture to be
accessible to people,

1375
02:04:44,777 --> 02:04:48,047
it's better if there's something
interesting about it.

1376
02:04:48,147 --> 02:04:52,952
Being dull doesn't affect
the quality of the painting.

1377
02:04:53,052 --> 02:04:55,588
Even if the setting's commonplace,

1378
02:04:55,688 --> 02:04:59,124
the painting will still have its own
unique value.

1379
02:04:59,225 --> 02:05:03,028
Even paintings
nobody buys are great paintings.

1380
02:05:06,565 --> 02:05:10,536
Come to think of it, she's probably right.

1381
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:14,273
Painting is my livelihood,

1382
02:05:14,707 --> 02:05:18,644
so she was just giving me some
helpful advice.

1383
02:05:18,844 --> 02:05:22,047
She wasn't judging me.

1384
02:05:23,082 --> 02:05:25,918
What was it that possessed me?

1385
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:31,957
That's a great thought.
Who said it? It really encouraged me.

1386
02:05:32,057 --> 02:05:33,926
(Ex-girlfriend) You said it.

1387
02:05:34,727 --> 02:05:37,663
Have you forgotten what you once said?

1388
02:05:39,298 --> 02:05:41,300
You haven't changed a bit.

1389
02:05:44,236 --> 02:05:46,639
I'm at a loss for words.

1390
02:05:47,573 --> 02:05:50,276
Bathed in the evening light
streaming in through the window,

1391
02:05:50,576 --> 02:05:53,112
she laughs mischievously.

1392
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:58,117
The ring on her ring finger sparkles.

1393
02:06:02,555 --> 02:06:04,657
(Ex-girlfriend)
We'll say bye here. Thank you.

1394
02:06:04,757 --> 02:06:07,893
Okay. I've got to get back
to clean up anyway.

1395
02:06:07,993 --> 02:06:08,994
(Ex-girlfriend)
Hang in there.

1396
02:06:09,094 --> 02:06:11,630
I'll send you the final paperwork later.

1397
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:12,765
Okay.

1398
02:06:12,865 --> 02:06:15,734
(Ex-girlfriend)
So, are you glad you did it?

1399
02:06:18,737 --> 02:06:20,172
It really feels like

1400
02:06:20,706 --> 02:06:23,976
these are my first
interesting paintings in a while.

1401
02:06:24,276 --> 02:06:28,747
I've gotten work too.
My future seems bright.

1402
02:06:29,715 --> 02:06:33,919
It's all thanks to those animals.

1403
02:06:34,653 --> 02:06:38,157
(Ex-girlfriend) You're so deadpan,
I can't tell when you're kidding.

1404
02:06:38,257 --> 02:06:40,593
Oh, sorry.

1405
02:06:40,693 --> 02:06:42,962
(Ex-girlfriend) I think it's
a great concept though.

1406
02:06:43,062 --> 02:06:45,631
Animals are cute and accessible.

1407
02:06:45,731 --> 02:06:49,268
The paintings had a coherent theme
and were easy on the eyes.

1408
02:06:49,368 --> 02:06:52,705
And it was quite amusing, too.

1409
02:06:52,805 --> 02:06:53,806
What was?

1410
02:06:53,906 --> 02:06:57,743
(Ex-girlfriend) Those animals
kind of resemble you.

1411
02:06:57,843 --> 02:07:00,879
Really?
Do I look that much like an animal?

1412
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:06,685
How can I phrase it? Your expressions,
your mannerisms. Your aura.

1413
02:07:07,186 --> 02:07:09,722
Like that cat.

1414
02:07:09,822 --> 02:07:12,791
It looks just like you
when you play the piano.

1415
02:07:13,325 --> 02:07:18,797
Eyes closed, looking upward
with your nose poking into the air.

1416
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:23,836
The piano?

1417
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:27,206
(Ex-girlfriend) Yes. The piano.

1418
02:07:48,227 --> 02:07:50,829
Dancing animals...

1419
02:07:54,166 --> 02:07:57,136
This is a series of paintings

1420
02:07:57,870 --> 02:08:02,007
of mysterious animals
that visted my home.

1421
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:08,414
After midnight,
they would sit near my piano

1422
02:08:09,014 --> 02:08:12,084
and dance a strange dance.

1423
02:08:15,854 --> 02:08:17,990
A strange dance...

1424
02:08:24,763 --> 02:08:27,099
A strange dance...

1425
02:08:35,908 --> 02:08:39,778
A strange dance...

1426
02:08:42,481 --> 02:08:46,418
It looks just like you
when you play the piano...

1427
02:08:56,395 --> 02:08:58,731
(Piano plays)

1428
02:09:06,972 --> 02:09:10,509
No, maybe it's the other way around.

1429
02:09:11,510 --> 02:09:13,912
Was I mistaken?

1430
02:09:15,013 --> 02:09:18,484
They weren't dancing.

1431
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:24,957
Maybe they wanted to play the piano...

1432
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:36,835
♪～(Piano Sonata 」Moonlight」)

1433
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:39,204
I stand before the piano.

1434
02:09:39,805 --> 02:09:42,808
Moonlight illuminates the piano keys.

1435
02:09:43,108 --> 02:09:47,112
As I look at myself in the mirror
out of the side of my eye,

1436
02:09:47,246 --> 02:09:50,315
I slowly lower my arms to play.

1437
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:54,219
That melody I have played many times,

1438
02:09:54,787 --> 02:09:58,957
Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14.

1439
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:02,828
I see myself in the mirror.

1440
02:10:03,362 --> 02:10:06,999
My body moves as I play the piano keys.

1441
02:10:07,299 --> 02:10:13,806
And it looks as if I'm dancing
a strange dance.

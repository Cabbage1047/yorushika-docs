00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:47,402
The scenery doesn’t change; on a faded afternoon
I’m lying in the deep indigo beneath the overpass

3
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:54,687
I hear a single clap for my blank-page life

4
00:02:54,712 --> 00:03:00,634
I was singing about my own emptiness today, as usual

5
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:22,937
So things wouldn’t change,

6
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:29,687
I wrote a story starring you in my notebook

7
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:36,177
My gas and water being cut off, society, and the news are all someone else’s problem

8
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:40,177
Look, my life is like ink

9
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:54,238
The dream I had when I was young gets closer to its expiration date as I get older

10
00:03:54,263 --> 00:03:58,956
Though I just, I just look up at the clouds

11
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:04,338
As usual, they flow through my field of vision

12
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:09,418
In the distant night sky I looked up at, flowers swam

13
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:13,379
So many that it could be mistaken for spring

14
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:18,279
As if I’d just lost sight of you

15
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,516
I looked down so I wouldn’t trip

16
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:46,049
Life is made of nothing but compromises

17
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:52,956
I don’t believe in hearts or fate or love songs or life

18
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:56,145
After all, if you can’t sell something it has no value

19
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:10,045
I intentionally discarded the present I dreamed of,
and now I’m lying here waiting for its expiration date

20
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:15,152
Behind my eyelids, I just, I just saw

21
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:20,437
An imagined, distant vision of you

22
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:25,258
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night

23
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:29,677
One more is in my eye

24
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,510
Life is just one compromise after another

25
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:35,693
I learned that pretty fast

26
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:37,127
Elma,

27
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:38,289

You alone are my music

There are only eighty more characters in this song

30
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:51,247
Because maybe the only value of a life-
is in the way it ends

31
00:05:55,545 --> 00:06:00,179
I just, I just picture you

32
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:05,462
As even the indigo filling my vision is blurred

33
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:10,054
In the distant sky I looked up at, flowers swam

34
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,937
Deep indigo covers my eyes

35
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,981
It’s just, it’s just…

36
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:32,762
In the distant sky I looked up at, you are cooling off

37
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:39,187
As if you were just swimming in the night

Under the blue sky, I waited for you

Hey, where do I go from here?

43
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:43,420
No one has told me how to proceed

44

I looked into your eyes and without a word I walked away

49
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:14,807
It shouldn’t be music, right?

50

Even if I drew a single line in my heart

52
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:31,147
No matter what I did, it wouldn’t disappear, even now, so

About all you humans or the truth or love or the world or pain or life

57
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,665
Wanting to know what’s right or wrong is just a self-preservation instinct

58
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,574
It’s your fault that I thought that

59
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:07,328
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand why I truly don’t want to get older

60
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:11,212
Just thinking “Someday I’m going to die” makes my chest feel hollow

Until the darkening night falls

524
01:06:00,397 --> 01:06:08,230
Pain and sadness, if you can’t see anything you won’t understand them so

525
01:06:08,612 --> 01:06:12,403
With my eyes shut tightly I ran away

526
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:16,303
I walk along the moonlit path

527
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:20,647
Cramped rooms and cold nights,

528
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:24,814
Dreamy afternoons and lonely mornings,

529
01:06:25,145 --> 01:06:32,264
Between the words of farewell I’m looking at your face

530
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:47,168
Just like this, in some faraway land

531
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:53,087
Relaxed, stretching out in the cracks of a pale summer

532
01:06:54,353 --> 01:07:03,837
While I can still hold in my words and tears

533
01:07:04,746 --> 01:07:09,699
While I’m still only looking at how blue the sky is

534
01:07:12,984 --> 01:07:17,960
While I still don’t know about parting with you

535
01:07:19,851 --> 01:07:23,166
I know I’m a liar, I feel it

536
01:07:23,191 --> 01:07:27,597
Elma, it still hurts

537
01:07:27,622 --> 01:07:31,241
So sing goodbye already

538
01:07:31,266 --> 01:07:36,874
Until the darkening night falls

539
01:10:44,191 --> 01:10:46,107

♪～Toumin
A Loser Doesn’t Need An Encore

540
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:10,266
In the schoolyard after the rain,

541
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:15,991
I remembered yesterday’s fireworks

542
01:11:17,004 --> 01:11:28,201
The faraway look on your face back then; I could still smell summer on the wind

543
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:53,935
After fall comes and winter comes

544
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,751
And I fall into a long sleep

545
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:05,028
Riding the clouds, riding the wind,

546
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:07,776
I’ll go far away–

547
01:12:08,643 --> 01:12:12,793
there’s no reward for me here

548
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:44,368
In the schoolyard where blossoms flutter, I remembered yesterday’s sunset

549
01:12:45,364 --> 01:12:57,180
How dignified and transparent you were back then; a trace of summer remained on your cheeks

550
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:22,066
When spring comes and I’m waiting for summer,

551
01:13:22,423 --> 01:13:27,466
Having awoken from my deep sleep,

552
01:13:28,496 --> 01:13:33,466
Becoming water, becoming flowers,

553
01:13:33,491 --> 01:13:41,249
I’ll look at the sky, not needing any words

554
01:13:43,668 --> 01:13:46,051
There’s no such thing as gods

555
01:13:46,076 --> 01:13:48,785
And “dreams come true” is a total lie

556
01:13:48,918 --> 01:13:52,501
So let’s quit work and school and everything

557
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:56,918
If it’s natural to forget

558
01:13:56,943 --> 01:13:59,968
Then don’t put the memories into words

559
01:13:59,993 --> 01:14:03,589
Seal them in your mouth so you don’t forget them

560
01:14:07,034 --> 01:14:12,064
When summer passes as I’m waiting for you

561
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:16,914
And I become able to see the end,

562
01:14:18,332 --> 01:14:23,351
Riding the clouds, riding the wind

563
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:29,353
It’s just like sleeping, but…

564
01:14:29,378 --> 01:14:34,337
After fall comes and winter comes

565
01:14:34,362 --> 01:14:39,178
And I fall into a deep sleep

566
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:45,262
Riding the clouds, riding the wind

567
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:47,945
I’ll go far away

568
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:52,991
There’s no reward for me here

569
01:14:59,853 --> 01:15:03,914
I just want to live with you

570
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:14,924
I just want to live with you

571
01:15:21,824 --> 01:15:25,624
I just want to live with you

572
01:15:32,839 --> 01:15:36,639
I just want to live with you
